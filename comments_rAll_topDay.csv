Nothing beats the feeling you get when you see them fall in love with it just like you did all those years ago
"Them: I don't think I like this game.

Me: But you haven't even played it for 5 minutes and are still in the tutorial."
Then you leave them to farm the smaller creatures while you either wait or help them kill them all with the click of a button.

"Dark Souls is great at this. When you first play it, it is like juggling. You see someone do it well, and you get the idea. However, you try it yourself, and it just doesn't work. If you keep practicing, and don't give up, eventually, something just ""clicks"" in your mind, and you suddenly understand it. 

One if my favorite things is watching my friends when they get the moment in dark souls, where everything just falls into place. Once it happens, they always love it."

"I'm often the ""them"" in this situation. Taking it slow and learning things for yourself is half the fun, when you've got a high powered ally just spoiling and telling you how everything is it makes it feel boring.

This applies both to MOBA style games where a difference in skill makes you feel useless, as well as grindy games where a difference in levels/wealth makes you feel useless. I don't wanna feel pressured to keep up with my addicted friends!

"The first time playing Journey is pure magic. You aren't playing a video game, you're having an experience."

"I love playing this game with others and showing the way.
And I am usually one antisocial mofo."
That game was beautiful. Staying warm with a stranger to survive... That's where that game truly hit me.
"I remember playing for the first time and not realizing the other person was a real player. They chirped, then I chirped. 

We seemed to understand each other‚Äôs chirps. Things like ‚ÄúOver here!‚Äù Or ‚ÄúHey!‚Äù We each had a unique chirp that we implicitly understood each other as.

EDIT: Did anybody else figure out how to fly completely? It was such an amazing experience coordinating our chirps to keep flying, that‚Äôd I‚Äôd always try and show new players"
"This is my experience in Warframe as well. In fact, when I was first starting off I would meet people (high MR) in low level missions who would offer to taxi me to high level alerts. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes, when I'm bored, I would pick up my Frost, go to lower level defense missions and just sit in the middle. ""I'm going to stay until 20, or later if you want, come to the middle if you get in trouble. Have fun."" (Readies Sobek with Acid Shells.)"

"This is something that I wholeheartedly encourage. In online games, veterans train newbies and spread the folkways and folklore inherent in the community.

"Same, I used to feel horrible when this happened, like I was some kind of boring loser. But I think it's probably just a difference in tastes, since afterwards I began to notice that they never played that genre of game ever so they probably don't enjoy it. That helped me feel better about myself. üòä"
"You're probably not doing anything wrong, you might just be trying to get them to like something that pushes all the wrong buttons for them.

My brother and my old friend have very similar taste in games, but I hate playing most of the games they love and I could never do it for long.

I still play a few games with them, we do have some similar tastes. It's mostly games where you can play in very different ways. I always prefer being reckless, tanky/bruisery and fast-paced, while they prefer slower risk-management strategizing, optimizing and farming. It's usually shooters/fantasy rpg's, like Borderlands and Warframe  (*Always 3d, 2d does absolutely nothing for me. I have several 2d games I never played through and kinda regret buying. Thankfully they're usually cheap.*)"
"They probably don‚Äôt like feeling stupid in front of you. 
Let them borrow it and figure it out in their own time, or go and make food while they get the hang of it. It‚Äôll also create a positive feeling with playing that new game with you"

GM tells us something like ""you hear a noise and are able to discern what looks like (insert medium difficulty monster here). What do you do?"" It's his turn, and he goes with ""FUCK YEA!

Dude gets 1s in every single dice, an epic failure.

One of my best friends and me are exactly like this dynamic

He loves to go in guns blazing, making as much noise as possible, as many explosions and bullet holes as possible, hates stealth levels with a fiery passion.

I love surgical strikes, being as quiet and unseen as possible, killing everything without ever being caught once (always sniper or rogue types), and stealth levels/games are my jam.

Borderlands 2 was a happy medium for us, as he got to do what he wanted playing Sal, and I got do what I wanted playing Zer0, and we could still play together without completely negating each others' playstyles."
"That's a good point. Even though I know it's dumb and they're probably not looking down on me, sometimes I don't like learning a game in front of someone who's already great at it."

"Even then, 20 hours isn't enough to finish some games. I just watched a video by a Youtuber who retracted their earlier opinion on Days Gone because apparently the last 10 hours were better than the first 25, as well as the game finally delivering on the horde clearing mechanic. 

The reviews are still out there, but they aren't syndicated anymore."
"Yeah, no. That didn't happen.

I wrote for gaming websites twenty years ago. Went to E3 as press, all that good stuff.

I usually had six or eight games to review each week. I played hard and usually tried to make sure I saw different aspects of the game.

But I never had time to commit 20+ hours to anything.

I thought I would love being a game reviewer. But like any job, it became work."
SkillUp and Raycevick do a great job imo
"""Ah, I miss the good old days when *insert hindsight biased statement here* SMH, things aren't like they used to be..."" Shut up, dude, the good old days are just the old days and people hate games journalists because they want someone to hate. 

You ever consider that some people don't play 20+ hours of a game when they don't like it? Would you do that? I know I wouldn't. Not to mention, the industry is rigged against journalists. As if they have enough time to play games for as long as the average consumer does. They're expected to review every major release in the brief period of time between when they're given a review copy and the game's launch, just so a bunch of jackasses can come over and tell them they're doing their job wrong. Why don't you try it? Clearly you would do so much better in the same situation. 

People give a lot of undue hate to journalists and make assumptions about them as a collective based on a few bad impressions. I don't go to IGN for reviews, it's true, they're not that great, but they're not a hive of terrible people who are trying to antagonize their audience. People like you do nothing but shit on them because you all need something to complain about. Grow the fuck up."

"I liked it, played it for a few more levels than the one you stopped at, it looks great and has amazing music but it was too hard for me to really enjoy, I like tough games but not everyone hits it for me, just like how I didn't like Sekiro despite loving all Souls games, and especially Bloodborne."
"The worst part about that game was how I hated every main character. You‚Äôd think with like 7 protagonists you‚Äôd find one you like, but they were all awful in different ways.

It‚Äôs bizarre that Snow, one the biggest scumbags and morons I‚Äôd ever seen, was one of the two primary protagonists. The game only got fun right at the very end for me, but I still regret playing it."

"No, you're supposed to have the party mourn his passing only to find his long-lost twin brother in a nearby cave."
"He rolled in the open bruh, what can you do?"
"I very much disagree with you. Level 1 is the most dangerous level. The situation certainly sucks, but players need to accept that characters can die. It also sounds like while the crit downed the wizard there was more tomfoolery that ultimately signed their death certificate.

It is fine to play by the rules. It is fine for the DM to fudge the rolls here and there in secret for the story (how often and when is a complicated personal matter). But the DM decided they wanted to do open rolling and crit, they shouldn‚Äôt be expected to change the rules of the game because it might kill a player."
What's the point of rolling dice if the DM just decides something else happens if they don't like the result? What's the point of doing combat if the PCs have plot armor and there are no consequences?
"As he said he rolled in the open, makes it harder to fudge it then without fucking up the integrity of the game a little. I get what you're saying though, that it's kinda shitty if that's you first experience of D&D. However if it feels liek the risk of failure isn't really there it makes the feeling of victory/achievement fade as well. I know right well that my DMs fudge things sometimes but I don't KNOW for sure, and so the magic stays alive."

I‚Äôve hated MOBA games since they started as DotA on Warcraft III. Tree Tag and Footies were 10x better.
"Conversely, one of the more popular FFXIV reviews didn't even finish levelling or bother to try to enjoy the story. Like, why?"
"If I remember correctly, the IGN reviewer for Sekiro said the game is pretty easy comparably. While many other reviewers said it's very hard."
"IGN is a real mixed bag because their review methodology boils down to throwing interns at the problem.  They have a lot of disposable reviewers they just chuck at games.  Some of them are clueless, some of them know their stuff."
what about the dude who couldnt get out of the Cuphead tutorial.
"Except TB insisted that his ""WTF is..."" series was not reviews. More akin to quick looks. He'd play a few hours of the game then show off the options menu and the core gameplay loop. Great for getting the ""feel"" of a game. Damn I miss him."
"Rest well, TotalBiscuit.  You taught me the importance of having a good, detailed options menu."
I Miss biscuit. Was generally entertaining. Loved his street fighter commentary. He didn‚Äôt have a clue what was happening but hyped it up.
I think TotalBiscuit and Yogscast collabs alone got me into the let's play genre. Missing the giant...
"Well, maybe I'm just less patient today, but I don't think ""it get's really good after 25 hours"" is a valid excuse. Games can and should be fun sooner than that. I'm okay with taking some time to establish everything, but 25 hours is too long.

Trim the fat. If there's not enough fun for 35 hours strip it down to 25."
Yeah but I think 20 hours is enough time to decide whether it's worth a purchase.  Although that could depend on the game I guess.  If it's heavily story-driven and the ending is some worthless garbage then maybe completion is more of a factor.  But I think 20 hours is plenty of time for a person to have a say on the actual gameplay mechanics.
A lot of people will never play past that twenty hours.

You should give it another go. Celeste has a very robust assist mode that allows you to customize the difficulty in a lot of ways. If you test it out even the worst players and those with motor disabilities can both enjoy and beat the game.
"You can bypass Dark Souls games' difficulty with grinding levels/gear/skills to the point that you can easily handle ""hard"" encounters.  

Sekiro and Celeste require you to execute a series of button presses accurately.  Grinding doesn't help you.  The only way to beat them is to improve the way you play the game.  These kinds of games aren't for everyone."

"It's hust like any other date really. You do an activity together while chatting. Not really that different from going to a bar or amusement park.

"FFXIV's story is very very Final Fantasy. 

Not everyone is going to enjoy that, no matter how hard they try."
"i remember someone reviewing warframe, a game you cant really start to have an opinion abot unless you played atleast over 50-100 hours because it snowballs into its own qualities, who never got past the first few level, saying stuff like ""all the weapons are boring, and the all the missions on the open world are way too hard""..

&#x200B;

someone checked his steam account and lo and behold he had 12 hours, and he only showed gameplay that would be equivalent to the first level... he got roasted for that"
"It is, just a lot of souls fans are so used to rolling through attacks and playing defensively which is the opposite of what you want to do in sekiro."
I agree with this opinion though. It is easy comparably.
"It‚Äôs probably the right way to do it, though. There‚Äôs probably like 10 new games a day on a slow day. There‚Äôs just way too much content for there to be a professional on staff person to cover everything. And they can‚Äôt miss anything because as much new stuff as there is there‚Äôs also someone that cares about all of it. Like they can‚Äôt just pick and choose because they‚Äôd be missing out on something 

It‚Äôs a competitive market. If you don‚Äôt have a video or a review on the latest game, someone else will, and eventually you‚Äôll just get replaced."
God help you if you didn't have a fully fleshed out options menu or rebindable keys! Which were definitely valid complaints.
Fuck I still miss this dude. His series was seriously one of the best...
"I mean, fine... But technically he *was* 'reviewing' the game, ironically in a manner that is more useful than pretty much any other review."
We all miss him.
"On a similar note, people have to stop trying to get people to like games by basically saying ‚Äújust keep playing it gets good you‚Äôll love it‚Äù till fucken Stockholm syndrome kicks in.  Like you shouldn‚Äôt have to play the whole game to know if you like it, you should know after the tutorial and the first level, maybe two if they are short levels."
"Same people with TV 

""Jusssst watch the first 4 seasons! It gets soooooo good after that!""

""How many episodes in a season ?"" 

""Uhhh.... like... 30. But they're only an hour each."""
I mean a lot about enjoying a game boils down to whether or not it's your thing. I followed Days Gone and was super excited about it until I saw all the crappy reviews. I ended up buying it anyways and freaking loved every second of it. Lots of reviews nowadays just really aren't even worth reading anymore.
"That's much more of an issue with games as a service though, that have a leveling/story phase, and endgame after that (where the ""real"" game begins).

Look at the glowing reviews Destiny 2 got when it came out, because 99% of the reviewers simply played the campaign and stopped after that.

Only the 1% reviewers that actually bothered to get into endgame found out how absolutely fucked it was, and gave the game absolutely terrible reviews (that it deserved at the time)."
"My thoughts exactly.

For every ""the last 10 hours are AMAZING!""-Days Gone game, theres another ""the first 20 hours are AWFUL!""-Final Fantasy XIII.

At some point a reviewer needs to say ""the game has good parts, but getting to the good parts is not worth it""."
"Kill him now, and the debt is paid."

"I mean the primary reason I do hate the vast majority of MMOs is typically because the content is heavily padded out and in many cases just not that interesting, i'd really rather just do a dungeon or a raid one time and move onto the next and then be finished with the game until the next thing comes out... But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work.

In most cases I would say the games are better experienced watching someone else do all the work for you."

"I'm not saying you have to like it, but if you skip every single cutscene in a final fantasy game and then you write a review, I don't even know what to say to you."
"Just like the Spider-man PS4 reviewers who were trying to play it like the Arkham games or weren't using gadgets. Then docked the game a few points for 'bad combat'.

Makes me think what games I may have passed up due to an unmerited poor review by someone who didn't actually play it (or someone assigned the review who doesn't even like/play/understand the genre)."
"Sekiro is a game designed to appeal to dark souls fans but also to punish them for playing dark souls.  

Truly masterfully it is harder for the players who most crave difficulty."
"After playing it for three hours, it became very automatic and easy, aside from learning new enemies.

All they had to say was explaining that parry is the new roll, and it wasn't agonizingly frame perfect dark souls parry, it was the very generous roll window.

The few times timing is very important, there's a giant red kanji in your face followed by a white gleam for your ""push button now"" moment.

I'm pretty sure a lot of reviewers just dodged all game and never learned that isn't what sekiro is about."
They removed most of the stun locking in dark souls so playing aggressively is reckless at best
"This makes me rethink Witcher 3 vs DS combat arguments.

Cause DS is roll and poke (sometimes a big poke üòè) but the Witcher's combat is designed differently from that. Is it clunky? Yeah, but I felt that way about DS especially when I make a single mistake and get combo'd to death by skeleton wheels."
imagine if they made the parry window as tight as it is in dark souls
"My opinion is that it is MUCH harder before it ""clicks"", and much easier AFTER it ""clicks"" compared to the same points in Bloodborne. I find Dark Souls a lot easier overall but I've also played that game for thousands of hours so hard to tell.

Bloodborne, before you ""get it"" you can still kinda brute force your way through things, but AFTER you ""get it"" there's still a lot of difficulty and limitations with stamina, knowing when to regain, etc.

Dark Souls, shields just kinda... make it a lot more accessible, and most of the ""click"" is just knowing parrying or how to safely pull enemies.

Sekiro, before you learn parrying, you're fucked. After you learn parrying, it's a matter of execution. There's no stamina bar, it's learning the rhythm of the enemy combos, sneaking in safe attacks to wittle down vitality, and knowing their unblockables."
"At least for IGN, I think it is the only solution.

It did KO him. The wizard then proceeded to fail his death saves.
"It was a party failure, not a DM failure (except maybe rolling in the open). He failed a minimum of 3 saves. 3 rounds of combat where none of his fellow party members cast a heal or used a potion or attempted to stabilize.

"Apparently, it‚Äôs a calculator: capable of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing."
"Making a small alu in minecraft is pretty easy, making the rest of the CPU is a bit technical, and then making the memory and the display is tedious. By small alu I mean simple, the most simple alu implements and, or, not, and xor, you could replace the xor with addition. And from there you need to implement some registers, and the CPU architecture, like can you do math on a memory address or do you need to load and store to do math on a memory address, from this point you need to design your pipeline, and then you need to implement the following operations: compare, and, or, not, xor, add, subtract, load, store and jump/goto/branch, and a conditional jump/goto/branch. And then you will have a turning complete CPU, just hook up some memory and a way to read the outputs and, you would have a programmable computer in minecraft, and if you exclude the add and subtract operations of the CPU it would theoretically be one of the more simple cups you could make, you could go super risc and have only a not and an and operation along with the non alu operations for the simplest computer in minecraft."

"It sounds like you just don‚Äôt like MMO‚Äôs in general which is a completely fair and understandable viewpoint due to the fact the genre literally is as you‚Äôve described. I think the problem comes with going into a game knowing the genre and the previous formula and decrying that formula. 

It‚Äôs equivalent to playing -any RPG- and complaining about having to level up. It‚Äôs an RPG, of course a level curve is going to exist. The complaint is completely justified when a game that isn‚Äôt an RPG or has no reason for a level curve to introduce one.

You wouldn‚Äôt have Wesley Snipes play a scientist in a film so why would you have someone who (whilst completely valid in their opinion) hates MMORPG‚Äôs review an MMORPG? You ruin any merit of that review or in the case of Wesley playing a scientist, any merit of the performance."
"I mean... You're basically asking to only pay the sub for like one month out of the year. If you were willing to pay that sub x 12 for one month, then that might make sense, but there's a reason they want you to continue playing. 

You might even say they're banking on it lol."
Massive Mega Macro Matrix Monster Mario Maker Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game?
"Spider-Man had really fun combat imo. My only problem was it was too short. They definitely could have made the story longer but the rest of the game was really good. 

I gave up on game reviews a long time ago though."
I'm starting to think about the IGN review for Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire.
"It's also hard to go into a game with a blank slate.  Like everyone was praising nier automata so I played it (very late) after playing dark souls 3 and devil may cry 5 so the game seemed very repetitive fast.  If I actually read reviews and went into it not expecting epic action but an amazing story I would have enjoyed it more.  

Or when i first played fallout 3 after oblivion and was bored quickly because i couldnt stealth like in oblivion. I've later played new Vegas with a different mindset and loved it."
Plus dodging backwards or to the sides gives you the shortest windows of invulnerability in the game. Forward dodge and jumping have more i-frames.
The difference being if you fuck it you're going to absolutely eat shit in DS. The window is tight still but if you fail you just block and lose posture.
I mean tbf parrying is like the biggest most constant part of sekiro whereas in dark souls you can get by with just dodge hit 9 times out of 10.
"I don't disagree. The thing about DS and BB is that one mistake will means you will probably die, there's really no punishment for failure in Sekiro for a minor mistake. Plus vertical movement which we have never had."
"Sekiro basically has a binary difficulty: Before you get it, and after you get it.

Soulsborne games had much more of a sliding difficulty curve, because you can level up your stats in those games, meaning if a boss is too hard, you grind a few levels, get a few more weapon ugprades and try again at an ""easier difficulty"", something that's not possible in Sekiro."
"Until we create an AI that can do it for us, of course"

"He passed away, unfortunately. It was a shock and a great loss to the community."
"Not only did he die, but the /r/gaming logo being a british flag heart with a hat an the letters TB is in memory of him."

Uh...buddy....
"He died, actually."
He died of cancer unfortunately
"I have a system. Get a zombie that can pick up items (they don‚Äôt de spawn when they hold something) put them in a glass tube (have dealings when working with zombies, helmets only last certain times) with flowing water so they are stuck in a corner. Have the corner block be removed (still stuck in but so a minecart can pick them up through the wall. Drop a villager in and wait for it to get turned. Have the minecart track that leaves from that corner and  have a fork in the track so you can send the zombie back into the tube and the other way sends them to the trading hall. From there cure them and place down a lectern (if you want enchants). Note sometimes a glitch hapenes where the librarian decides to untrade themselfs so ALWAYS have the stuff to buy the books (couple of emeralds and books) because once you buy from them they are locked but before you make that first trade, if you back out to go grab your stuff to trade they might lose that trade you wanted

If you guys want a vid I can make one since this is my own design based on things I‚Äôve seen different people do. I have not seen one do it this way, the closest I‚Äôve seen is Ph1lza does this but doesn‚Äôt realize zombie villagers that you make do the same thing. 

I‚Äôll probably make the vid tomorrow or the next day once I finish it myself because my old world deleted itself so I had to start over

Edit: forgot to mention that villagers only take on trades during certain times of the day

Edit 2: should also give advice on getting emeralds. With this technique not many emeralds and needed so the farmer isn‚Äôt needed. This is mainly because the librarian sells 3 bookcases for 1 emerald after you cure them. 1 emerald buys you 9 books than sell those books back to the same villager for 1 emerald for 1 book or something close. AKA FREE STOINKS"

"Probably meant the DM could have made it non lethal and had them stable but unconscious. Maybe turn it into a kidnapping if you need further reasoning. They don't know the Kobolds stats.

"Personally think the levelling vs the end game experience is what makes the MMO genre such a hard genre both to get right and to sustain... levelling often a completely different experience than max level... and levelling 3-6 months after a release is a different experience as well, just because of population...  


This makes MMO's hard to get into for people who don't already have a group of friends playing or who aren't getting in at the start of an expansion... but it also makes the games hard to review because you spend a week on a game that then might be a completely different experience once you get to max level..."
"I was all set to upvote this logical argument, then you went and dissed the good name of Mr Snipes."
"I actually liked Guild Wars 2 for the most part, just nothing about the MMO qualities.

Even Wildstar I actually did sorta enjoy outside of the end-game content and all."
"It's not purely monetary though. Half of the allure of MMOs is that you can be much stronger than other players and carve out a unique identity in the world. If everything were easy to get there would be no power dynamic and no balance to the in-game economy.

They generally reward high-level play and heavy organization; it's not easy to get a strong raiding team together, especially when one single player can ruin a boss fight.

I don't have time to play MMOs now but I don't think I would enjoy an MMO that required less of a time investment because of the above"

One of those kids is going to ask for a Red Ryder BB gun claiming how impossible it is to put your eye out with one. Do not believe his little lies.
Those will be the two most moisturized white men in America. Post more pics in the future.
My friend just adopted 3 girls (same mom) and the final one was a couple weeks ago.   Wish your aunt the best and the kids the best.  Your uncle looks so damn proud!
"Congratulations and love to all people who choose to foster and adopt. It‚Äôs a funny thing. ‚ÄúOutsiders‚Äù praise you for your selflessness, bravery and for doing good. You just want to have kids in any way possible, You don‚Äôt really see it their way. Your view is you were blessed with the greatest gift of life‚Äîto nurture and watch another life blossom right in front of you.  And to share a love so deep, it boggles your existence. To love and be loved is what got us there in the first place.

Source: I miscarried 3 times, once after IVF. We then adopted our son at 1 year old and he‚Äôs the Joy and fulfillment of our lives. He‚Äôs proud he‚Äôs adopted and freely talks about it. We‚Äôve always celebrated it. We are a happy family. I hope everyone gets and shares the same fortune. It‚Äôs a fortune of love.

Edit: it‚Äôs always special to be recognized. Reddit upvotes and awards show we all just want to be loved. Good life karma to you all! Thanks for the love!"
"That‚Äôs lovely! I hope they all have a beautiful life together.

Edit: Side note, the judge looks happier than the parents. That‚Äôs cracking me up! The Dad‚Äôs face is like ‚ÄúOh boy, what did we sign up for.‚Äù üòÇ"
I always told my wife that we probably don't have good enough credit score to adopt white children
"Holy shit they adopted Ralphie and Randy!

For the love of all that is good in the world, get those kids to the Christmas Story house in Cleveland, and send us all pictures.

It's what Jesus would do.  I think."
"‚ÄúNot flesh of my flesh, nor bone of my bone, but still miraculously my own.‚Äù

The bond created through loving another human being as your own, with no incentive other than love, is an incredible privilege.

"My family and I are white. My parents adopted my little sister, who is african american, when she was 3 months old. My parents have a picture of all of us that is very similar to this (with the judge, in a courtroom) hanging in their living room. My little sister is now 20 years old, and I've never known her as anything but my little sister. :)

Congrats to your aunts friends!!"
The one with the glasses kinda looks like the kid from stuart little
"Dad's got that ""I kinda want to cry right now"" smile.  Here's to a happy family!"
Isn‚Äôt this the plot to the Jerk?   Congratulations!
This woman has a very motherly look to her. I bet she gives the best hugs. Those are two lucky little boys.
I'm glad to see [Judge Phelan is still on the bench](https://youtu.be/XBk9HssQVlw?t=38) doing his good work after all these years.
I know this judge! He signed off on my adoption by my stepfather last August!  http://imgur.com/bU609qJ
I love how the boys are in matching clothes. Sweet family! Congrats to your friends :)
"Congratulations on finalizing the adoption! What a beautiful family. May your family be blessed with love, joy and happiness for years to come!"
"First reaction when I saw this:

&#x200B;

*Ten years later*

&#x200B;

""What?!  We're adopted?!""

&#x200B;

Jokes aside, I'm so happy for all of them!"
"Hell on earth is being an unwanted child.

Heaven on earth is being chosen because you are loved. I dated a girl who was adopted at age 8 and she remembers that day with such gratitude. To her, it was the day God told her she was truly loved.

God bless your Aunt's friends. That is literally the best thing anyone can do."
"The mother looks like:
I'm gonna make ma boys some good fucking food. Every. DAY. FOREVER."
"As an orphan who was adopted at the age of 10, pls give that couple a huge ‚Äú thank you‚Äù and hug from me."
"My son, who is a (very) white boy, is very close to his black grandfather (his grandmother remarried when he was a baby). His grandfather used to joke that when they would go to Walmart together, people would look at him like ""where the hell did that black man get that white baby!""."
"What a beautiful family, those boys are too adorable."
One kid is going to be a problem child and the other is going to have one hell of a Christmas story
‚ÄúI was born a poor black child down in Mississippi‚Äù
We're in progress on our second adoption from foster care. It's rough but we're so happy we chose to do it. Congratulations to them!
Those kids are going to get some of the best hugs ü•∞
Did they adopt the kid from A Christmas Story
"Yep, that man is 100% dad."
Oh that made my day. I am crazy sick with chemo right now but I suddenly felt so happy. those little guys are so cute and I always love it when the judge is in the picture too. I wish them lots of happiness and love.

Is that Stuart Little‚Äôs brother? The tables have turned.
"Mama looks so happy, and Daddy looks like he‚Äôs trying not to let his tears of joy show. üòä.  She looks so loving and sweet, but also strict.  Those boys will be loved, safe and heading towards their MD/PhDs in no time.  üòÜ"
Looks like the Dads ready to rocket launch into space.
Those are some happy looking kids. I hope I can adopt one day.
"I just noticed this, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen a black couple who adopted white kids. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs bad, I just don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen it before."

Kid on the left looks like the kid from Stuart Little
awesome! looks like a happy family
Those kids are going to end up with some of the best food on the planet and the funnest life . You can see it in dads eyes!
For some reason that judge looks like 2 people on top of each other.
Plenty of people do this the only reason this is so popular is because it‚Äôs an older black couple who adopted nice looking white kids; now that‚Äôs something you don‚Äôt see often. Respect to them though regardless.
Congratulations to your aunt's friends? Confused why you would be using this to get karma
Do the kids get the N-word pass?
Are they brothers!?  I hope they're brothers.    :)
"Dude my parents are black

Yeaa right man"
Not going to lie they look genuinely very happy. They look so happy it's making my damaged dark soul feel a gleam of it.
"This might get buried but generally it's not a good idea to post pictures of adopted children online because the circumstances of their removal from their birth family are likely unknown to you. In some cases the birth parents are dangerous, and some are actively searching for the children. This person may well have had permission but just to raise awareness.

Source: close to me"
So happy for them!
"Thats awesome, congrats!!!"
Haha the guy on the left looks real thrilled. Or like he‚Äôs gotta poop and just wants to get out of there.
They all look so happy :) may this be the first of many family pictures
Isnt the one on the left friends with Stuart Little
That‚Äôs too sweet.
The kid from Stewart Little never ages...
The dad looks like that guy from that Tyler Perry show
Dad on the left looks so proud! Love it

That is awesome.
They adopted the kid from Stewart little!
The boy on the left immediately made me think of [the boy from Stuart Little](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BYmE3ZGIzZmItZGY0ZC00NWIyLWI5MzUtN2JmYjRkNjk5N2FmXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNjcyODYyNzk@._V1_.jpg).

The kid with the glasses looks like he owns a talking friendly mouse that‚Äôll live it‚Äôs life like a normal boy his own age.
I don't know what it is. But that dad looks like the most dad that ever dad.
Hell yes! I love seeing positive uplifting news!
Congratulations. 4 happy people. Wishing your aunt's friends the best. Awesome picture.
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen white kids adopted by black parents
Didn‚Äôt know reddit was the Facebook of a 55 year old retired mother
I think it‚Äôs great that lady adopted the boy from Stuart Little.
"I'm adopted and all I want to say is thank your aunt's friends for providing these kids with a promising future. 

Lots of love ‚ù§Ô∏è"
That woman has one of the kindest smiles I‚Äôve ever seen.

This is so sweet! Adoption is a wonderful thing :). I was blessed to be adopted by an awesome family 30 years ago next month! And I got to meet my biological mother and cousins for the first time last year. It‚Äôs so cool to have so many new family members!
Congrats on getting a J. Lipnicki clone!
Now all she needs is a mouse named Stuart Little.
Time to sort by controversial
May all the best be on them and may fortuna give them its favour.
"Dad over there looks like he's going to be giving car 101 lessons in about 5 years (class 1; the check engine light is for dummies, we're just going to pop the hood and run the codes ourselves.  No, don't take the car to the dealership)."
The kid on the far right looks a bit old...
"As an adopted kid lemme tell you: they will appreciate this more as an adult than they do now. I always saw the downsides but when you get old enough, you realize someone choosing to love you and raise/take care of you without any prior attachment is one of the greatest things that will ever happen to you."
"I'm 60 and adopted. I was 16 days old at the time. My family had a saying, ""Blood may be thicker than water but love is thicker than blood."" I always knew. In fact, if f I knew anything growing up it was that I was really really wanted by my adopted family. Love and light to those that open their hearts to kids who need a home.

And the other can't put his arms down.
"The one on the left will tell you all kinds of random facts, like how the human head weighs eight pounds."
I was thinking why they adopted him and not stuart little
*Fudgggggggggggggggggggggge*...
And then he's gonna convince Tom Cruise to marry Renne Zelweger.

"I‚Äôm white and my cousins are mixed. One time, I slept over at their house and the next day we went to church. My cousin put lotion all up in my hair before we left, same as she did to herself. I looked like a little greaseball."
As a white male who has moisturized since my lovely neighbor/extra mom from the Cayman Islands got a hold of my ashy elbows. I completely agree.
"My hubs is white so I have lots of white family. It's been 15 years, they're all constantly surprised at the amount of moisturizer around me at all times. Like, what do you think this is, a fucking game?"
Those knees look ashy already
[bill burr white people need lotion NSFW](https://youtu.be/vWJphD0sg1I)
White people get ashy too. My elbows could cut glass.

I just tried way too hard to stifle my laugh and ended up making a horrible sound through my nose that I can't even describe. This waiting room just got very judgy all the sudden.
"Woah woah woah.... I u/rayraymaybeso claim the title of most moisturized white dude alive (red hair for extra points).  My Haitian girlfriend dunks me in a tub of cocoa butter EVERY NIGHT.

MUHAHAHAHAHA!!!"
"Haha I‚Äôm a nanny for two African American kids and sometimes it feels like most of my job is hair and skin care. Mind blowing how much more it takes to care for them, versus my white skin and blonde Caucasian hair!"
It‚Äôs OP‚Äôs aunt‚Äôs friends not their aunt and uncle just a heads up
He does look really proud. I hope those boys put that look on his face as much as possible.
This is spot on.  My wife and I adopted a sibling group of 3 almost a year ago.  We were placed with the oldest and the younger 2 were born over the course of a 4 year dependency.  We had similar issues with miscarriages and that is why we decided to foster to adopt.  I can‚Äôt imagine loving anything more than I love my kids even if we shared genes.
Username checks out
"If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, how hard was the adoption process?"
"I was adopted. And hell yeah I know what your kid feels on a spiritual level. When you know you were chosen, there's something extra there. You don't share blood or even look like the parent(s) who raise you, but you know you are loved and above all wanted regardless of any of that. It doesn't leave room to doubt. You're never plagued by those awful thoughts wondering if your parents ever truly wanted to have you or if they just had an oopsie and dealt with the consequences. The answer is right in front of you the whole time.

I would love to adopt someday, when I have the means to. I feel it's my duty to pay it forward. I'm 37 weeks with my first daughter now, and I would love for her to have a sibling. Adopting a child is one of the coolest things you can do as a human being. I'm so happy you get to experience that despite your hardships."
"I love this comment.  Adoptive mom here.  I wanted another child.  I wasn't brave or selfless or doing good.  The sun rises and sets on my children, my joy."
"as the son of a parent that was adopted(my mum was adopted) i really love my grandparents because they are the nicest people and only ever loved my mum, in fact they actually forgot she was adopted that was a cute moment i was there for, the only downside i feel is i have no real idea about my genealogy am i actually closely related to royalty or a celebrity, probably not but who knows? Also the ""any family history of X"" FUCKED IF I KNOW??????"
">You just want to have kids in any way possible, You don‚Äôt really see it their way. 

I plan on adopting at some point but I definitely never wanted to have kids in any way possible. Biological children just aren't it for me, there are already kids here that need so much love that it doesnt make sense for me to personally have them.

Edit: My little sister also had a horrible reaction to the DTaP vaccine around 3 and I'm doing my best so I can set her up for her best life (aka my life) so that's like basically already  like having a kid for me."
"Adoptee here. I don't know to describe it. You still have typical issues and challenges with your parents, but I couldn't love my mom more for choosing me. Even now as an adult we're deeply close. We're very genetically different, but our love for each other is the same. I also think the fact that she told me about my adoption from an early age helped me to be well-adjusted about it throughout my life."
"I raised (am raising) my husband‚Äôs two kids from a previous marriage. No formal adoption or guardianship but I‚Äôve been blessed to do ‚Äùmom things‚Äù for them every day. Sure I missed the baby years, but I still had a part in getting them to adulthood. I would do it all over again."
"Congrats and all that. This kind of post reaffirms my decision to stay child free though. It‚Äôs such an alien concept to me, everything you wrote about having kids in any way possible, greatest gift, the nurturing and watching life blossom bit, etc. Just zero interest whatsoever in any of that. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll ever be able to feel the way you described."
The judge must see a lot of  human misery that can't be fixed. Good that he can experience this as well!
"The judge is likely very happy.  We are proud adoptive parents twice over, and both times the judge and courthouse staff were thrilled for us.  They even bought us gifts.

The second judge explained to us that family court is usually really stressful and intense, and often doesn‚Äôt have a happy ending, so when they get a happy ending, they embrace the fuck out of it.  

Also, in our jurisdiction, the final court date is just a formality and the family‚Äôs presence isn‚Äôt required, so they don‚Äôt always get to see the family at the moment they become a legal family."
"I think the dad is thinking more like, "" Let me just tighten my abs and.......... ok go ahead."""
Dude just skipped 3am feedings and colicky infants.  My wife and I were thinking of having a second and would *if* we could honk out a 5-year-old.  Loved having a baby but they suck up a lot of time.
When we finalized our adoption the judge and her clerks were so happy. They said that adoption finalizations were the best parts of their jobs because they see so many heartbreaking cases.
I thought Dad looked beaming and holding back tears.
"Plot twist the guy in blue accidentally walked into the photo, which explains his look."
I see him as a very proud daddy who is puffing up with pride over his new family. And mama looks so pleased and content with her new sons. This looks like a very loving and happy family. I truly wish them all the best and joy that is sure to come their way.
"I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs ‚Äúadoption day‚Äù or what but according to my friend who is a family law judge, adoption day is like Christmas for judges and staff. So much sadness and trauma permeate those court rooms that everyone looks forward to the one day where everyone that walks into the courtroom walks out with a forever family. 

Best of luck to this family!"
I‚Äôve appeared before this judge on a case before and he‚Äôs a great person and testament to the bench. Glad he got to be part of this moment.
You might be able to find a discount Russian one
I found this extra hilarious for some reason
Adopt one from West Virginia... Or Mississippi
The first thing I did was scroll for the Christmas Story comment.  I just saw the whole movie in my head with different parents and it was 5 out of 5.
Amen to that! My brother wore a tux and a top hat to his adoption at 3 years old. My mom hangs those pictures in his office and our 18-month-Old niece gets a huge kick out of seeing pictures of her uncle as a baby.
There's probably also a mouse in the adoption photo somewhere
Came here to say the same thing!
"Came to comments to search ""movie"" etc. because to me both of them looked so familiar. 

And yeah I think the blond looks familiar because of Stuart Little but I'm still wondering about the other one... I feel like maybe some spy movie or something."
I was born a poor black child..
"""He really hates those cans, stay away from the cans"" I love that movie."
 You mean I'm gonna stay this color!?
Beat me to it.
The new phone books are here!
You know she cooks good too.  One of them boys is gonna have child hood obesity but it‚Äôs okay cause he will grow up with manners .
"Scrolled a looking way to see this one, well done"
So cute I wonder if they are twins!
You just managed to summarize all the good will things I wanted to say. How dare you.
"I hope one is also blessed with the strength of several herds of cattle and the other has the agility of 100 cats.

Mostly just cause I think that would be a cool team up and I'm too lazy to build upon my superhero ideas on a creative way."
I'll never not upvote adoption photos.  I love the creation of families and loving homes.
"""I was born a poor black child...""

(Is this reference too old now?)"
"I‚Äôm not adopted, but this comment made me cry a bit."
"My little brother (adopted) is Cape Verdean and my mom is blonde-haired, blue-eyed, fair-skinned. We used to get looks, too. We‚Äôve long since stopped noticing."
Upvoted for alluding to my favourite Christmas movie of all time.
"also when the kids get married way down the line, you can make this joke ""People kept saying dont you know what makes kids?"" ""Yeah the paperwork"" both my aunt and my mum are adopted was there for her wedding grandad made that comment was funny"
Looks like the adopted both kids. Ralphie and Randy?
Send hugs. I hope you get well soon.

"Stats back your observation:

77% of adoptive mothers are white.

90% of Asian adoptees, 64% of multiracial adoptees, 62% of Hispanic adoptees, and 55% of black adoptees were adopted by mothers of a differing race.

Only 3% of white adoptees were by a mother of a different race.

https://ifstudies.org/blog/the-changing-face-of-adoption-in-the-united-states"
Because the parents are black and the kids are white so it shoots straight up the algorithm to the front page. Would be the same if the parents were white and the kids were black.
"Yeah, not sure why you're being downvoted. ""Hey look at this person I happen to know exists!"" This is some classless shit right here. Good for them for adopting those two boys but fuck op."

"I don‚Äôt think I understand. You adopted the older one and then the biological mother continued having children and sending them your way?

Sorry for my ignorance."
"Just wait till they grow up, then your genes might fit."
"I have one biological child and having him made me realize that it didn‚Äôt matter whether the baby was biologically mine or not. I know some fall in love immediately after birth, but it took me weeks to build a bond with my son, and months to build a deep love. He could have been any baby and I would have fallen in love over time. Maybe it‚Äôs different for some people, but I think for most that‚Äôs normal and it helps us as a species love for one another and adopt children into our families."
It sure does
"Not the OP but it varies if you want international (each country varies), domestic infant, or through the foster system. I suspect each state's foster system varies and within a state, it depends if the kids' parental rights have been terminated already or not"
"My sister adopted two children out of the foster system in GA. They had to go through the normal process that you go through to be a foster parent, home visits and all that. The only money that they had to spend was on lawyers and court costs. Adoption is always risky, but foster to adopt can go pretty bad. There's always a chance that you could have this child for a long time, only to have a family member come out of the woodwork and take custody, so you can't really feel comfortable with the placement until the adoption is final. That can take anywhere from a few months to years, depending on the child's situation."
"We adopted in 2005 from Russia. It was expensive, around  $40k. We were doing really well financially at the time. Russia closed its doors some time after because a small percentage of adoptive parents can be crazy freaks. That‚Äôs another story, except to say one woman literally sent her son back on an airplane with a note. Yep. That happened (in US).  Russia pretty much closed their doors not long after that one. 

Others have posted info from their experiences. Since ours doesn‚Äôt exist any more, here‚Äôs what I do know:

-the adoption agency is key.    We used European Adoption Consultants out of Ohio. They were good because they had deep, trusted  connections in the adopting country,  they understood the process, and knew how to follow the convention of the players involved. They were smooth. Establish your confidence in an agency by asking questions, talking to other adoptive parents that used that agency, etc.

-we had a great social worker. That‚Äôs important too. She was full of good advice and resources. She made great recommendations about being open with our son that he‚Äôs adopted, celebrate with a ‚Äú Gotcha Day,‚Äù honor his heritage and his questions, and make strong physical connections‚Äîskin to skin. We hugged and held. We bathed together (early days all three of us).  He slept with us often. We knew this was important to him because before we even knew all this, we all slept on mistresses on the floor in the hotel in St Petersburg. Our son stretched between us, head touching me, feet touching my husband. We knew he needed a lot of touch and we‚Äôve continued that to this day. 

Best advice, follow your heart and you can make it happen. It took us a year, which was pretty fast from what I‚Äôve heard. Fostering is more complicated and has a longer timeline. If you‚Äôre willing to have a child with emotional or physical challenges, that can go faster and I believe there may be stipends to support that in some conditions. Like I said, I don‚Äôt know much outside of what we did. I applaud anyone that even thinks about doing it. It‚Äôs the greatest blessing of all. Good luck!"
There are all different kinds of adoption so the route you choose contributes to all the preparation that goes into it.
">or if they just had an oopsie

My parents let me know I was an ""accident"" when I was fairly young. They were done having kids basically. But then I happened. Mom didn't seem to think that statement could possibly have any negative effect on me either..."
Where do you live/were you adopted from? Depending on these two things there are likely laws/practices that can help you here. Might also depend on how long ago the adoption occurred.
"Get a DNA test done through a place like Ancestry.com.    They link your DNA with any family members who've also had a test through them.     They also tell you how closely related you are to those people;  ""immediate family"" - then it branches out to cousins and how far removed they are.     

They give you email options if you want to get in contact with those people, but they don't show you the actual name of the member (unless they signed up with their actual name).

They also give you a place to build your family tree out.   While you can't do the research yourself, without a doubt, there's someone with your genetic profile who's into genealogy that will have the family tree you're in posted on the page.

Just an idea.  ;)"
Same. Turns out I don‚Äôt have the greatest DNA being diagnosed with not one but two rare and ridiculous diseases at 30 but I decided I was gonna adopt when I was in second grade. My best friend was adopted and I sorta just decided that‚Äôs what I would do bc without that she probs wouldn‚Äôt have been in my life. Later when we learned her bio mom was super into drugs and 14 that decision was pretty much cemented.
Adoption day at court is by far the happiest day.
"My buddy is a family judge in the rural parts of South Carolina. He will not get into specifics, but he tells me he is floored by the awful things parents will do to their children."
happy cake day
My neighbor is a family court judge. He is energetic and friendly 99% of the time but sometimes I see him chain smoking in his driveway with a thousand yard stare. Tough job. He must see a lot.
"That‚Äôs basically what our judge was like too, when our aunt got full guardianship over me and my brother. I remember him saying that, 
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not always that I can get an outcome where all parties in involved are happy. Especially in family court‚Äù"
"I asked the criminal court judge I worked for at the time if he would do our wedding. He said ""Of course! I'd love to use my powers for good for once!"""
"This is exactly what the judge that did the step parent adoption for my husband said (he was adopting my daughter from a previous relationship). We sat at the court house and ended up being the very last case for the day. We walked in and the judge apologized for the wait, saying family court is usually all kinds of bad stuff, and when he has adoptions, he likes putting them last so he can end his day on a high note."
Awwwwww
"I‚Äôve been to family court once (when I was the child. I had just turned 18 so it was the final child support date). It was weird to see all the cases ahead of ours, then it gets to us and the judge was just happy our case was mundane and didn‚Äôt have screaming."
"Worked with a family court once, literally the most miserable interactions I‚Äôve ever seen. It‚Äôs incredibly sad watching close family go at each other mentally and physically for the wrong they‚Äôve done to each other."
">if we could honk out a 5 year old

I mean, you *could* adopt a 5 year old. dont let your dreams be dreams"
"I always said the perfect kid would come out at 5! Walking, talking, no diapers, no naps, and be more fun."
I can't  stop laughing at honking out. Im about to be beaten by the mother of my kids. :)

"Hair lotion and skin lotion are usually different. When you hear ‚Äòhair lotion‚Äô it usually means a styling cream. Basically all of our hair products are about adding moisture, hence the name."
"It's a different kind of lotion actually. There's all different kinds but they're referring to one called ""pink oil moisturizer lotion"" and it looks like lotion but it's made for hair. It's good for making it softer and giving it a little shine :)"
"It‚Äôs an extra product to be used post shower (or to your discretion).

"A lot of us have grown up without exposure to all the different norms of different races and cultures so it's ok if you didn't know, IMO.

Dry skin just shows up easier on darker skin. For example, one of my white friends' skin can get very dry to the point where it's uncomfortable for her but you can't actually see any flakes. For me, even if I'm only slightly dry with no discomfort, it's ash city."
"I learned from dating a black lady. I made a joke about how much lotion she had and how I should buy stock. She then didn't put lotion on one arm for a day and showed me the difference.

"The oldest was a foster child that was placed with us.  His biological mother had 2 more children over the course of the foster care dependency.  I am not sure how it works in other states but in Arizona when a parent has a child removed by the state and the case is ongoing any additional children born are automatically removed and placed in foster care as well.  The family fostering the child already in care gets the first call to take placement of any siblings.  If they say no the baby goes to a different foster family than their sibling.  

The case with out kids took over 4 years partly because their bio mom had 2 more children.  Everything seemed to start from scratch again when a new baby came.  We adopted all 3 at the same time.

Our kids are full siblings (all 3 have the same mom and dad) and their bio parents had already had their parental rights severed for 2 other children 10 years prior.  If another sibling is born we will not go through another foster dependency.  That is a situation I wish on no one."
"This happens. My cousin adopted her son who is the 5th child his birth mom had, the other four are with the same family in AZ but couldn‚Äôt take a 5th. She‚Äôs currently waiting for another placement, but it‚Äôs always in the back of her head that his birth mom is going to have more and she‚Äôll adopt them too"

"I have read court case transcriptions from family court. I have the utmost respect for the countless judges who do this job every single day and do it with grace and compassion, in spite of how monstrous some of these cases are. I can't fathom how difficult it must be.

Family court judges see families on their worst days. These cases wouldn't go to court if the people involved could sort things out amongst themselves. It's a severe situation in need of external judgement in order for everyone to move forward. So these are truly people on their worst days, but often these are people who are dealing with other issues already, compounded by a custody dispute. In all of the cases I had to read through, *every single one*, the judge was driven by compassion and ensuring the children had the best possible outcome. These were not easy decisions, but they explained their reasoning, and I couldn't find fault in any of them.

I know some judges aren't good people. I know that some have done despicable things (some even in my state). But there are a lot who are humble and kind and do their best to make the responsible choice in situations where no one else is capable of doing so."

Neat.   Don‚Äôt see that on mobile app.  But neat.
"I stayed with a friend once and just picked one of the shampoos to use,  my hair looked worse after the shower. Her mom was mad cause I guess it was an expensive shampoo too."
"I'm white but I totally buy hair products intended for natural hair. Mine's pretty wavy/curly (and bleached at the ends) so I just use most of them only on the length, and it's awesome. I think it's just too much moisture for most other types of hair, at least on the scalp.
 
A good friend of mine is black so it's cool to be able to recommend products to each other. There's a fractionated coconut oil on Amazon that's pretty badass; I know she and her family liked it a lot too if you want the link. I'm still on my first bottle but she said they've gone through like 5 since I sent her the link. üòÑ"
"Ok, serious question here: I'm a white dude with fluffy hair. That's the best way I can describe it, it fluffs up like a halo around my head. Will shampoo for POC help weigh my hair down? I just want my front bits to lay down instead of floating around my forehead."
"Ha, I'm white but have very curly hair and use special shampoo.  I was traveling with a friend and she forgot shampoo and borrowed mine.  She came out the shower convinced I'd accidentally put conditioner in my shampoo bottle because her hair felt so gross, haha."
Yea we need a lot more moisture for our hair lol I imagine for y'all its just like a wet mess
"The trick is to only use it on the length of your hair, not the roots. I have curly/wavy hair and can't use products for natural hair on my scalp, but a lot of them work really well on the length. :)"

"Do black people just have naturally dryer skin? My family is dark enough to the point that dry skin would stand out, but we are downright oily. I don't understand how someone could get noticeably dry skin in one day."
"Dark skin shows dry, dead skin patches really clearly- ""ashy"" is the word used to describe this- compared to pale skin, so black people use moisturizer all the time to combat this. It is also common for black Americans to express amazement at how unmoisturized white people are, since they were brought up putting lotion on every day, or multiple times a day, and would feel physically uncomfortable with dry skin much sooner than a white person."
"As a white kid who grew up in the suburbs, I didn‚Äôt know or later, understand why darker skin folks used moisturizer or lotion until well into my twenties. I was clueless about dry skin having a different appearance.  i never criticized someone based on dry skin, it hadn‚Äôt occurred to me."
The comedian Bill Burr has a funny bit about this (NSFW language): https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vWJphD0sg1I
"My sister in law is Puerto Rican, and always complains about ashy skin. My brother and I have been calling her Ashy Larry for years."
"Darker folks get ‚Äúashy‚Äù from the dry skin which appears white sitting on the black skin. So it‚Äôs a stereotype that black people have to use more lotion/moisturizer. I‚Äôm mixed and I use baby oil with coco butter, but I‚Äôm also only dark for half the year."
"As other commenters have said, dryness shows up more prominently on darker skin, especially around the elbows and knees. In the black American community they refer to it as ashy because it literally looks like gray ash. So using lotion is highly advocated in the black community and it is also sort of a point of humor."
"Boy, I really hope somebody got fired for that blunder!"
Interesting. Thanks on behalf of all of us I‚Äôm sure for being such a good person and stepping up for those kids but holy shit those parents sound awful.
Holy christ talk about saints and sinners. How can two POS keep being such POS? Man the 3 you adopted were lucky to be loved. I was a foster kid and I wasn't loved and that shit is rough. I'm really glad there are people like you and your wife in the world.
"Oh fuck, I misread your comment and thought you were adopted too. My answer was suggesting you could research your bio parents. That being said, your mom can definitely try (assuming she wants to). I‚Äôm in the US and the adoptee has to make the request. Since your grandparents are still alive, I‚Äôd recommend she act now while they can assist. A friend of mine is about your mom‚Äôs age and just met his bio mom a year ago. Turns out he has a few siblings and has been meeting them."
"For sure they do! You‚Äôll never see a judge beam a smile they way they do at adoptions. As you likely know, most adoptions are the result of a lengthy process. I wish you and your family the very best!"

I hope he has a therapist he can talk to confidentially. My friends who work in law carry a big burden.
"I worked as a bailiff (essentially a courtroom manager) in a juvenile dependency court. At first I told my girlfriend about some of the horrible things that I heard, but then I realized that nobody else needed to be burdened with the knowledge of what parents can do to their own children, especially infants.

Luckily most of the cases were concerning drug-addicted parents, but the few physical abuse cases were unforgettable. I don't know that it says anything about your character to not share the details. After the first couple times you just realize it makes the people you love feel sad to hear about it, and sharing it doesn't really make you feel better."
yep!
"I had a complicated relationship with my dad too, went years without talking to him at one point. But I take some comfort in knowing that he never stopped loving me, and that if there's any kind of life after death he loves me still. I just miss him so much."
At least it's not Detroit.
"Went there and loved it.  We decided to go as a lark, and damn all the wholesome feels that came flooding back....my family always watched ‚ÄúA Christmas Story‚Äù during the holidays, so this meant more to me than I knew.  Got some purely lascivious pics with me and the lamp too!"
"Can confirm. Am adopted, but only found out a few years ago (I'm 38 now)"
"I have adopted cousins, step cousins and step cousins whose bio parent is no longer married to my relative. They‚Äôre as much family as the rest of them. I often forget they aren‚Äôt really blood related. I‚Äôve heard some insecure remarks though and it‚Äôs saddening"
"I'm adopted and I've also felt like an outsider my entire life. Adoption is a really difficult thing to talk about,  especially for the adoptee. Most people don't recognize the trauma a child experiences when separated from their birth families. Even as infants, we are not blank slates. Even if we've always been told we're adopted,  there is still a lot of secrecy, shame and guilt tied to our pasts.  I highly suggest she read the book ""The Primal Wound"". This book is profound and helped me heal in ways I never thought possible."
"Congratulations on finalizing the adoption! What a beautiful family. May your family be blessed with love, joy and happiness for years to come!"
"A very close highschool friend found out she was adopted when she turned 18. I guess it was part of the process they agreed to, a letter from the birth mother written 17 years prior. I don't know why my friend all of a sudden saw her entire life as a lie, and threw away all the love and support she'd received from her loving parents and siblings. Her siblings never knew. They were all younger than her. Anyway, she flipped out. She found her birth mother and extended family, only to find out they'd all had a terrible life, most of them drug addicts in the  backwoods of Kentucky. My friend is currently in therapy for ""survivors guilt"". I'll never understand her reaction, how it instantly invalidated the entire world. She still says things like ""I'm not even supposed to know you. We never should've met"". The psychology of adoption is  so complex."
That was probably the best thing that mom could ever do for her kid.
"Honestly, I'm proud of that mother for making the best choice for her child at that time. Adoption in Australia is extremely hard, and the bio parents are usually the one that prevents it from happening"
Checked a few comments on their profile and it seems that every comment made by this account is just a copy of another comment in the same thread.
"Lol, copypasta in the same post? The things persons do for internet points."
I like the tin man
"Same. I have frizzy poofy hair (it's fine, but there's a lot of it. I think it's like Eastern European hair). I went looking for argan oil conditioner on a budget and the cheapest was Cantu from the natural hair section. It's wonderful as long as I don't saturate my scalp. It also makes my wavy hair look texturized, kind of curly, and a little less triangly. I dig it. The only thing more effective is a really good haircut, and because I've moved so much, those are rare.

Edit: for the purchase conscious, Cantu is not black owned. Shea Moisture is a popularly available product that I think was black owned or is partially, but it's not fully. I check [for online lists like this](https://trialsntresses.com/natural-hair/product-reviews/black-owned-natural-hair-brands) when I have the money to invest in black owned businesses.

There are lots of reasons to buy black owned, and one of the most compelling is that black entrepreneurship is way down since the 1970's, which contributes to economic inequality. Here's a brief video on the topic, but also see Big Mike's first Netflix show for more in depth information: https://youtu.be/71FmkfENYDI"
Sounds like you might have wavy or curly hair. I'd recommend visiting r/curlyhair for some tips and products. Or you could just look up the curly girl hair method. It's for guys too and there's a lot of them that post of the curlyhair sub.
"Wait, what conditioner is this?? My boyfriend is white but every hair dresser, white or black, gives him so much shit about how dry his hair is even though he oils it every day and washes it like once a week. 

HE NEEDS THIS CONDITIONER"
"I'm white but I got 3b long hair.  I went decades doing the wrong shit to my hair cause I'm a guy and didn't care enough.  I also didn't ever consider using leave in conditioner cause I felt that would leave my hair nasty.

I didn't start getting proper coiling with my hair until I started using leave-in conditioners designed for 3b/c hair.  It's not quite kinky, but good lord will it massively fluff out if I let it.  All the hair conditioner I use now I find in the ""ethnic"" hair section."
"Is your hair super curly? Feel free to message me, it took me years to figure out how to treat my curly hair."
Nah it's just easier to see dryness on dark skinned people because your dry dead skin cells flake off leaving behind a powdery looking residue. It gets real bad if you live in dry climates. I am Caribbean/white mixed so I do fine in humidity but during the winter I look like a fish out of water (lips and nose).
"I'm an average white guy and most normal soap dries me out. I ended up using the hippie soap and lotion. I'm then usually good for the day. Depending on the season I will dry out pretty quickly the older I get. Winter kills me, my hands will crack and bleed if I'm not careful. Worse if I'm in the shop.

She lotioned after showering and before bed usually. It made a difference for her. I can't speak to all black folks but that's pretty common for ladies from what I've been told/witnessed. I buddy of mine wouldn't lotion usually and we'd call him ashy Larry to fuck with him."
Yes. Dry skin and hair. Hence the need for moisturizers.
"ooooooohhhhhhhhhhhh

thank you!"
"LOL

I'm not black, I'm Filipino and pretty brown. Growing up, whenever I would watch movies or TV and I'd see a white character get out of the shower and immediately put on their underwear and clothes. 

I'd always think to myself, ""Eww, don't they put lotion on first?"" 

Now I know it's a cultural thing. Thank you lol"
"I have never heard this but it makes me laugh for some reason.   Not the discomfort of others, but the saddened amazement about unmoisturized skin."
"Somewhere in this thread someone just had an ""Ah Ha "" moment over Ashy Larry."
Excellent explanation!
Im a white man who got in the habit of moisturizing every day and i can absolutely feel it if i miss a day. My skin starts to feel crackley and dry.
"White people should moisturize too , might not think you need it but when you get old your skin will remind me you should have ."
"Also one of the good reasons why black don‚Äôt crack. 

All my friends from school look young compared to me because they would lotion regularly. 

Had I known."
I‚Äôm almost 50 years old and you taught me me something new today. Thank you!
"When I was in college one of my housemates touched my face and marveled at how soft my skin was. I was like ""um ok?"" But then I touched her and I was like ""Wtf.. it's so dry!"" I'd touched a few white people before and just thought it was a coincidence, but then I realized oh damn she must not moisturize at ALL. It's like a thick piece of paper!"
"I didn't know this until I volunteered for a kids day camp. There was a little girl in my group that kept whipping out this bother of lotion several times a day and would slather up while muttering about being ""ashy"". I finally asked a good friend of mine who proceeded to pull like 3 bottles of lotion out of her purse and tell me all about it. I was floored. No idea."
Thanks for this explanation. Grew up in a 90%+ white town and I don‚Äôt think I would‚Äôve ever known about this. You learn something new (and super random) every day!
White person here. What if my skin isn't dry but too oily (esp. the face) still use moisturizer?
"In our house it‚Äôs baby oil for the brown and black people.  :)

Edit: mixed race family"
"I'm black and the lady I see gets pissed because I don't lotion daily and my skin never looks dry. 

I have absolutely no explanation for this because as I was growing up I definitely had to do this. I even take hot as fuck showers that should dry me out but for whatever reason I dont get ashy as much anymore 

But it works out because my hair fuckin sucks and taking care of it is a hassle while hers works with her easily. I COULD just keep it cut low, but I like the longer natural look on me with a fade"
The problem is - as a white girl - is nearly every lotion feels like my pores are clogged and/or breaks me out :(
"I think everyone should use moisturizers, healthy skin ftw!"
"thanks i watched it, bill burr always a legend :D"
"give her some lotion damn it, be a good brother in law :D"
"The worst part is they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúyoung and dumb‚Äù, mom was in her late 30‚Äôs and dad was in his early 50‚Äôs.  Just terrible people."
I'm glad YOU are in this world!
"It was so fun.  We are hoping to adopt again within the next year, and we will 100% bring dinosaurs to share with everyone if we get to!"
They certainly do! A therapist would be a good idea-
Thanks for sharing your experiences.
"I‚Äôm sure he understood and he lives on in you and in your children. Anytime you can share a lesson he taught you, that‚Äôs him living on through you."

She‚Äôs known her whole life but I know she struggles with feeling like an outsider in our family. She‚Äôs a fantastic person and I wish she didn‚Äôt feel that way.
"Sorry to ask but, how did you take it? I know it must've been a shock to learn that after 30+ years."
"*Anyone* can make a baby. But the people who raised you, loved you, fed you, taught you, are your Mom and Dad."
Parents who adopt should really tell their children that they're adopted as soon as the child is capable of understanding it.
This has been the newest bot karma farming that is occurring to age accounts to be used to begin selling things on Reddit. It will soon post pictures of shirts with witty sayings or other things on topic to the like of particular subreddits and a tandem bot will post an amazon link to where they can buy it if someone asks. They get fairly elaborate and almost every mod of a large subreddit will tell you how hard it is to fight these things. They take away from the human experience on Reddit.

"Does he use conditioner specifically for black people? If he'd like to try it I will say there are two types of conditioners we use. One for in the shower that can be used to ""wash"" instead of a shampoo, and then a leave-in conditioner that is applied after the shower while the hair is still wet, which helps keeps moisture in, in addition to a little olive oil."

I know it says detangler...but this shit is some kind of weird Voodoo in a bottle. I have the most ridiculous curly hair...like little orphan annie type curly. This shit...with one wash makes it look like Katt William's hair. It's just completely moisturizes the hell out of your hair. Bonus, it smells like carrots..."
I mean my mom's family is Middle Eastern and some of them are pretty dark and they don't really moisturize so it must have to do with oiliness as well.
Me and the wife discovered this fun truth about hair as well.  Skin was obvious but she needs to constantly shampoo her hair or it gets hella oily.  Meanwhile me and the daughter are having chunks of conditioner in our hair and shampooing maybe once every 3 day unless it was a sweaty day.
"Idk if you tried it but I switched over to the dove for men soap and my skin feels so goddamn nice now, I can't believe how shitty most men's soap is and women's soap tends to make you smell like you got attacked by a bath and body works"
Not Ashy Larry!!!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Am black. Can confirm. I have three different kinds of lotion at my desk at work.
[Here's Bill Burr on lotion.](https://youtu.be/vWJphD0sg1I)
"Yeah, had no idea that was a thing. I only use moisturizer in the winter when it's super dry out."
"
I'm white and I use lotion all over after the shower and have since I was like 13.
Honestly thought other white folks did this too..."
"I worked at a day care and there was a little African American girl who was sent with a tub of moisturizer at the beginning of each year and instructions to use it on her hands and and feet during every diaper change.

Unrelated but cute story, her name was Michael.  She had 3 brothers.  Her father wanted to name one of the sons after himself, and the mother kept telling him ""next one"".  Well, they decided that their 4th child was going to be their last, and so the husband told the mother that he didn't care if she was a boy or a girl, this baby will be his Junior.  And so Miss Michael was born.  She was the cutest funniest little thing, I miss her quite a bit.  She was small for her age and had a voice like a chipmunk.  She'd probably be around 8 or 9 now."
"it's mainly a girl thing, but it's a black guy thing too by extension because of our mothers (I'm black). You'll also see young black guys always brushing their hair because their mothers are constantly telling them ""yo head is nappy"" everyday, all day, forever and ever because a lot of them straighten their hair out and forget what it's like to have natural black hair so they think everything is nappy.

And don't get me started on the insistence of using cocobutter. Just thinking about the smell makes me want to throw up."
Google ashy Larry
"""I thought he was just covered in flour or cocaine"""
From ashy to classy.
"Did it always feel crackly and dry before, or has moisturizing every day conditioned your skin to ""need"" it, so that going without it is now harder than it was before?"
"I think this has more to do with darker skin absorbing harmful UV less deeply, more so than surface moisturizing."
"The best way to moisturize is from the inside out

"My nieces are adopted and one from a similar situation. The mom was 30-40 and the dad 60-70, she'd already had all her children removed.  Did drugs through the pregnancy too.... the girl is tiny but otherwise amazingly healthy.  But the whole situation is infuriating that it keeps happening."
"That‚Äôs wonderful! Best of fortune to your family, this is so sweet!"

"It sort of can‚Äôt be helped - kind of both being a part of and apart of... I always knew I was adopted and my family were fantastic but I was always unsure; felt like someone gave me up.  I‚Äôve since found my bio mother (when I was 26) and bio father (a few years ago when I was 48) - they‚Äôre both ok and I see where I get things from but they‚Äôve never been ‚Äòmom and dad‚Äô. 

Both my parents (adopted ones) died last year and I‚Äôll tell you the only thing I wish I could do is tell them how much I love and miss them, and how right they did by me even when I thought I was missing out on something - it‚Äôs only now I realize how much I had. 

Hell you can be 100% blood with someone and feel they were a stranger; the whole ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not theirs because I‚Äôm adopted‚Äù is an illusion."
Definitely go out of your way to tell her and let her know. I am sure you guys already do but the reassurance is good.
"It was like I was experiencing every emotion at once. I only found out because I had a vigilant older brother who never gave up looking for me, and finally found me on Facebook, despite my name being changed. It was the craziest message I'd ever gotten, and at first thought he was an identity theif lol

I've ""known"" my whole life, deep down, that I didn't belong. I'm taller than both my parents, they both have light blue eyes, and mine are hazel and can change color. I've always been the weirdo of the family. I knew something was off, but couldn't place it. 
When I found my biological mom about 6 months after I started talking to my brother, I was shocked at the things we had in common! Mannerisms, beliefs, and oldly enough, into the same ""lifestyle""! (I recognized a branding of a certain symbol on her and had to ask haha)

It felt like everything was falling into place. I finally felt a connection, like I belonged. Then, after talking everyday, to talking every other day, then maybe once a week, and now, I don't know the last time we talked. It was like I was abandoned all over again. 

Some background: When I was around 1, I was brought to my future family's overnight daycare. My mother was a stripper at the time, and also a heroin addict. I was just left in my carrier, long enough to have flattened the back of my skull, diaper rash I had to be hospitalized for, my stomach was swollen from not eating, and signs of jaundice. I was left with a bottle of spoiled milk. I've heard different stories from different people about how I am in the family I am in now, and I don't really know what to belive anymore from my parents, because if they've kept this from me for so long, what else? (I am now the caregiver for my elderly mother, and live with her because she needs constant care. Her children she birthed never come by. One is lazy, and the other, let's just say this ""godly, wonderful savior of a woman"" is NOT a nice lady, and just threw away a whole daughter. I was abused by her verbally and physically from a very young age, until I stopped her mid-swing at 17.)

It's the savior mentality that comes along with adoption that bothers me. I know ""not all"", but quite a lot seem to adopt because they have a hole they want to fill, or trying to paint the perfect picture of family, just to keep up with the Jones'. I felt like I've been groomed since childhood to fill the role I'm stuck in now. If I leave, she'll have to go to a home, but cannot afford to do so. I guess mama's little ""evil and crazy devil worshipping child"" is not such a bad human after all.

...just realized I vented a bit, probably didn't answer the question, but at least I feel better now Iol"
Boom!! And that‚Äôs how it is <3
"""He may have been your father, boy, but he wasn't your daddy."""
THIS. It will %100 ruin the trust your child has in you if you don't. I still feel like I haven't gotten the whole story.
There needs to be a way for the community to mark and shame these
You just reposted the gold comment from an hour ago. Bad bot. Bad.
"No he doesn't. I honestly never even thought to look for conditioner meant for black hair. We use a Moroccan hair mask in the shower and oil outside the shower (i have straight, fine hair but oil does wonders for everyone). If you could recommend a brand for a wash and a leave in, that would be amazing. I hate just picking up random products and either kinda liking it or hating it. It's hard to find good quality stuff."
I‚Äôm also curious about this because my mother‚Äôs family is Hispanic and they can get really dark but I don‚Äôt have any experience with being overly dry or ashy
"You think this is why ""black don't crack"", but a lot of white men's skin starts looking like a  topographic map by the time we hit 60? Imma start moisturizing."
"I'm glad someone understands! I keep Eucerine Smoothing Repair, Eucerine Intensive Repair, and Coconut oil on my desk. Sometimes I need just the right combination to make my skin perfect for the day. It mostly depends on the weather."
What's some cheap good lotion that i can find in europe?
"One of them has to be cocoa butter lotion 

I have so much cocoa butter shit lol"
"I'm a white fella, and a teacher. I remember the first time a black student asked if they could borrow my lotion. 

I don't have lotion. No males in my life growing up used lotion.

I got confused by being asked for lotion, then the student got confused by me not having lotion as any respectable person should. It was a great time."
This bit is actually the thing that finally got me to start moisturizing. Some true public service announcement right there.
This needs more upvotes. He‚Äôs funny as hell
"I think certain skin types are more oily or dry, though. Lucky for me, I have both - an oily face that hates moisturizer, and hands, feet, knees and elbows that will literally crack and bleed without it."
What the fuck kind of parallel universe am I witnessing here?? I‚Äôve never used lotion before in 30 years of existence except when some girl put some on me in middle school and the only thing I remember about it is it felt fuckin gross all slimy and shit...I don‚Äôt understand the hype
White person with very dry skin here. I have to exfoliate and moisturize at least once a day.
So Star Trek Discovery's Michael Burnham was based on a true story?
Michael is a unisex name so is ok. I don't think it's used much for girls in the Anglophone world. In Hebrew is Michal. King David wife name was Michal.

"Cocoa butter is the best thing for scars ever. 

Dude around the corner fell off his moped and had some road rash, used some cocoa butter and you can't even tell."
Yo fam don't down cocoa butter that shit is the truth
"I‚Äôm a white girl and I remember back in 8th grade in science class my black boyfriend was running his hand through my hair, playing with it and his fingers got caught in a snarl. He loudly exclaimed in a shocked voice, ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know white girls got naps!‚Äù The whole class cracked up and the teacher explained through her laughter that they were called ‚Äútangles‚Äù üòÇ"
"Alright whats wrong with cocoa butter? I had super dry skin as a white kid, and one of my dad's friends brought me a tupperware of his mom's cocoa butter. That shit saved my life in elementary school"
"I grew up in a mixed neighborhood but most of my black friends kept their hair long or real short and edged up but when I went to prison, waves were the dominant hair style, so you'd have dudes spend literal hours brushing their hair or never taking their wave caps off."
"I never noticed the dryness before, I think I was just used to it like a smell. I started using moisturizer to heal from a grilling accident then just grew to love it. I notice a very clear difference in my skin. If I go a day without it feels like swimming in a chlorine pool without showering"
Higher trans-epidermal loss from not using lotion also can age skin prematurely
It‚Äôs so polluted all our fish have aids.
Pittsburgh is actually an awesome city though.
"I was touched by this. I'm sure your parents (adoptive ones) knew how much you loved them. Doesn't make you miss them any less, I'm sure."
"Beep! I mean, I agree!"
"Yeah have him stop using shampoo. Honestly it just does more damage. I‚Äôm white but I use co washing as a way to combat the dryness of my hair. I use As I Am Coconut Co Wash. it‚Äôs available at Walmart, Target and sally beauty. I also put regular conditioner on it too after wards and then use leave in conditioner. I use Renpure‚Äôs leave in. It doesn‚Äôt make my hair greasy. I also alternate with Renpure‚Äôs cleansing conditioner. And then once a month or so I won‚Äôt do anything to my hair and let my natural oils build up and then use a boar bristle brush to distribute it. 

Shampoo is basically soap for your hair and soap strips the natural oils out of skin and hair. Imagine how dry your hands are after washing them a bunch of times in a row. Why do that to your hair?"
I just made that connection as well.  I think you might be right.
Drink lots of water too.
"It‚Äôs actually not about the lotion though, it‚Äôs about the melanin.

"I've been there.  Occasionally, I'll run across a lady who does not have any lotion with them and I'll get confused in spite of myself."
"I have largely the reverse.

Which is as gross as it sounds."
"Hahaha I feel your pain, I‚Äôm like this too. I have to make nose less greasy as a day to day routine but also have to make sure my hands don‚Äôt turn into dust"
"Your face might be dry and over producing oil to compensate. If you haven't tried a good facial moisturizer, try it out."
Agreed. I have never needed lotion in my life. I find a healthy mix of greasy foods and drinking lots seems to keep my skin quite supple.
"You are blessed with good skin. I‚Äôve always had drier skin, to the point that a line across my knuckles will crack open and bleed in the winter. The hype is that I can exist in cold places."
"So it‚Äôs not wrong that all humans, regardless of race, constantly have dead, dry flakes of skin covering their body at basically all times. On people with darker complexions and skin tones, it shows more easily as the dead skin cells will always be white/opaque. People with darker complexions use lotion as a way to smooth out their complexion and reveal their actual skin tone, rather than looking like they selective rolled parts of their body in flour. White people typically don‚Äôt lotion the way darker races do, because the dead skin cells are effectively camouflaged against whiter skin tones. So white people don‚Äôt need lotion for the same aesthetic reasons that darker races use it.

That said, there are times when anyone‚Äôs skin gets unhealthily dry. Think of chapped lips, but on other regions of your body. Lotion and moisturizer helps heal the cracks and splits in the skin, and helps soothe those areas (which usually either itch or hurt). So if you‚Äôre white, and your skin is relatively healthy (ie, not cracking and causing pain), then there‚Äôs not much reason to use lotion. Some people do it regardless. I have a friend who‚Äôs white and puts lotion with sunscreen on her face every morning and moisturizes again every night before bed, but she does it because she wants to avoid wrinkles on her face for as long as possible (ie, aesthetic reasons). 

To;dr - Lotion is only needed for aesthetic reasons or to help heal dry, cracked skin that‚Äôs painful or itchy. There‚Äôs really no need to use it if neither of those apply to you."
"I haaaaate lotion. It feels awful in my hands and awful on my skin. The only time I heavily use it is in the winter for my hands (the crack and will bleed), and even then I don‚Äôt let it touch my palms. I use gel moisturizer on my face because it doesn‚Äôt feel as gross and melts in better."
I'm unfamiliar with this reference.
"*Was* a unisex name. It's pretty much a masculine name now. Ancient Judea doesn't exist anymore, and words change.

"Bruh, I had a scar from when I was a baby. A hot iron had dropped on my thigh. That iron mark was there for sooooo long. My grandma would rub cocoa butter on it every time I saw her. Eventually that shit just went away 

Cocoa butter is the main ingredient in black girl magic, probably. Wait, do we have a black boy magic? I'm mad that I can't just use black magic because that's an entirely different thing lol"
" I'm a white dude, I love the smell of cocoa butter, how could you not? I thought we'd have one thing that we could all be united on."
Damn straight it is!
"Yeah, it has the culture of philidalphia without all the insanity"
I think it's probably a combination of moisturizer and higher levels of melanin which better protect skin from sun damage. So I'll use a lotion with SPF for the full effect!
"thanks man, i need to start looking into this"
"Aww, sorry."
"Are you Italian, by chance?"
Try applying your lotion to partly wet skin. It'll absorb better.
"Same here, I feel like I need to wash my hands after applying lotion. I only use lotion on my elbows during the winter when they get super dry.. but even then it's unpleasant having to squirt in in my hands to apply it... its like it leaves a greasy layer as if I just handled a fatty hamburger patty that leaves a residue on everything you touch, especially your phone and mouse and keyboard, and gets on your clothes and furniture. When I do moisturize for a sunburn or something, I also prefer to use gel moisturizer like that green slime aloe vera gel, love that stuff."

"It's not that they're shy, but they're so anxious, socially anxious I believe, that they would get pregnant but they'd never be able to deliver due to such high amounts of stress. There's a video you can find that talks about it. The dogs help keep them calm, and socialize them more so they can give birth eventually"

"bending of facts to make news stories seem more adorable?

The dogs are paired with cheetahs because they're friendlier with humans, the cheetah understands the dog to be part of it's family unit and follow's its ques.

Probably suppressed due to being fed copious amounts of food.
A lot of zoos only take animals that are struggling in the wild for some reason. But you arr entilted to your own opinion
I think both

"They usually dont separate them, since the cheetah and dog grow up together the cheetah considers the dog a friend and actually is really friendly to it. 

Here's a vid of a adult cheetah and dog that grew up together playing: 
https://youtu.be/Ndlf5_L5gsE"
"Cheetahs haves have dull, non-retractable claws and are much lighter than large dogs. They are endangered for a reason."
"Cheetahs are ambush predators, they usually wont attack something that is their size or seems capable of defending itself. Plus if the cheetah is well fed it would have absolutely no reason to attack an animal it grew up with and was friendly with."
They remain bros. The program was started in the 70s and not a single case of puppy-dineritis has happened. This only works when the big cats are in their imprinting age - the first 12 weeks of their lives.
"They remain friends. Do a search for ""cheetah and dog friend"" and you'll find lots of stories and videos of zoos that pair these animals.

Side note (irrelevant, but I thought it was interesting): Cheetahs, unlike most cats, can't retract their claws."

"You don‚Äôt even need to go for a serval. We have 2 F2 Savannah cats which are the best. It‚Äôs pretty much half serval half bengal. 

They are as friendly as a dog, while still having the entertaining personality of a cat but still being so athletic and somewhat wild. 

They are so intelligent as well, like our smaller one can mimic noises so well so just loves to sit and talk to the birds all day while the bigger one is more about basking in the sun.

Very sweet as well; if I‚Äôm sick like during chemotherapy they both pay extra attention to grooming me or just laying on me and supporting me.

You have to be a little careful once they adopt you into their pack they definitely like to get ornery and bite/scratch you as they play with you.

Still super gentle around babies and kids though"
"Depends on where you live. Some states you don't require any kind of permit or licensing for exotic pets, some states require a permit, some states bar the personal ownership of exotic animals.
Not sure how that works outside the US, but that's how it is here."
"Cheetahs don't eat people. They're smaller than humans and bigger cats like lions and tigers, and their claws are actually dull because they can't retract them. They're like the cat version of a dog in size."
Well if you have them when they are young they will remember you and will not attack you (as you are like a parental figure to them)

That was MY question- since they grow up together do they get to STAY together? ü•∫
"Aside from the pregnancy thing, cheetahs take social cues from their siblings. If their siblings are other cheetahs they grow up skittish around people because they're naturally that way but when they observe their sibling dog being calm and comfortable around people they too become that way which obviously helps a ton with their care."

So they probably arent very territorial or aggressive."

I hope they have comparable lifespans or there's a really bittersweet movie ending in there.
At the San Diego Zoo they are in the enclosure together and the dogs have their own little placards in front of the exhibit. It‚Äôs pretty funny to walk past a rhino and giraffes and kangaroos and then you turn a corner and there‚Äôs a golden retriever sitting on a rock panting happily
"Yep. If you go the San Diego Zoo Safari Park, they have what they call ""The Cheetah Run,"" which is a long (football field length) patch of grass where a cheetah can get up to full speed. When they do showings, the companion dog comes out first and does the run first. Sometimes they make jokes about what an odd looking cheetah it is."
The San Diego Safari park has a Cheetah and Dog in an exhibit and both are fully grown. They would chill and play together it was really awesome to see.
"Yes, this is practiced at the San Diego Zoo. When a cheetah is in the enclosure for public viewing or is an animal ambassador for closer encounters their dog pals are present with them. The cheetahs pick up on the dogs energy so they‚Äôre less timid around people."
"I keep fish and aquarists do the same thing.  If you have a prized large fish that doesn't come  out enough you add ""dither fish"" to the tank.  Small schooling fish that are always in the open  and your shy fish sees them swimming out front and doing okay so it thinks its okay for him to come out to and it does."
"My local wildlife rehab center did the same to help their new wolf get more comfortable with the keepers. They let him bond with their pet German Shepherd. When I was there on visitor day the wolf didn't want to come out of his ""den"" and the dog kept running up to him, trying to play, then running back to the fences to see the people, then running back to the wolf. It was pretty cute!"

"Unlike bigger cats, a familiar cheetah is one you can actually turn your back to. They will not attack though they might approach playfully. Cheetahs have more in common with house cats than lions or even leopards."
Well of course it‚Äôs not in there nature but if they are treated well by you they will not be aggravated like how mike Tyson had a tiger
"Not actually that true with Cheetah's, most big cats tolerate humans less as they get older but Cheetahs have been kept as hunting animals back to the ancient Egyptians (I hesitate to say domesticated because that typically results in some alteration of characteristics) .

"I was thinking more along the lines of rehabilitated/zoo cheetahs. 

They have a fairly docile nature, are curious animals, and generally don't see humans as prey. They're pretty damn awesome and are super chill. 

Obviously these big cats should never be owned as a pet, they're still wild animals, but if I had to choose a big cat with the least chance of being mauled, it would definitely be a cheetah."
Common house cats still have their animal instinct  because their species is still technically wild as the one first taken into captivity are still around and wild. That are the same species. Only cats aren't big enough to do damage to you other than bit ankles or fingers. That's why if you turn your back to them they will stock you like a lion stocks their prey
It's not wild anymore if you tame it. Tigers are more aggressive than Servals and if there are people with Tiger pets than people can have Serval pets.
"Pets have animal instincts too. This is no different than owning a cat, just a bit bigger."
Exactly I personally would never do that cause they were born to be free and you shouldn‚Äôt take them away from that but if people are into that they can do it

"This might be because the wheel is to small for him. At least in this, it look like his back would be arched when he's running and that'd give him back pain.  A wheel for Syrian hamsters should be at least 28cm (~ 11inch) but most people prefer to buy a 30cm diameter wheel,  just to make it comfortable for their hammies and be extra sure :)"

I have yet to come across a cage that actually meets the recomended minimum size."
"It still would. It's not about how wide the wheel is, but about the diameter."

"If they were chewing on their bars **and** climbing on their bars they were really bored and stressed, which means that your cage was way to small"
Keanu said it so it‚Äôs all-encompassing.
"Hamster balls are divisive, but I think that it's the only part of hamster care that's up to the individual hamster. My hamster hates free roaming and just hangs out in a single corner panicking, but is so much more confident in the confines of his 13"" balls. We have a routine - he potties when he gets up at about 10, he takes his dinner into his house, and then when he comes out, he hops right into the ball and gets to roll around for 30 min before we go to bed. He's never peed or pooped in his ball, nor has he ever injured himself in it."
"The pet store is filled with SO many dangerous toys and treats. I seriously can't stand going and seeing kids picking out small rodents and then grabbing the cute pink ""castle"" cage because they don't know any better."
"Wait, really?

My hamster loved the ball üò≤and it was big enough for him. He always went inside of it on his own and started running."
"When I had a hamster, I would only use the ball when cleaning its cage."
I‚Äôve seen the aftermath of a hamster who accidentally rolled a little too closely to a flight of stairs. RIP.
"It was a torture device to my sister‚Äôs hamster. Why? Not because she was running around inside it or anything. She LOVED that part. But rather because my rabbit would shove the ball across the room when the hamster got near her. Sometimes my rabbit just saw her out and got irritated that the hamster was even in her room (they had to share a room), and would push her across with all her might. My rabbit was 3.5lbs of pure firey rage most of the time. Poor hamster."
What is bad about the hamster balls?

"They actually used to have massive rota stack with wheels, lots of things to chews and all sorts to play with, I‚Äôve had 7 happy hamsters in my life. A few were rescues where this was learnt behaviour and they were hoping for a treat. No hamsters spending all night chewing bars here."
"Ok, torture device is propably a too hard term. I didn't remember the right word at the time üòÖ I was just expressing what I've been taught all the time. If you're hamsters really only wants to run in a ball, then that's better than no exercise :)
 I'm in German hamsters groups. They're a bit more extreme when it comes to how to treat your hamster  :) like, if your cage is not at least 100x50 cm for dwarf and 120x50 for syrians, they'll verbally tear you apart üòÇ (I'm conforming to these standards because I think, better more space than to little )"
Lots of the pocket pets also come in very sick. I work at Banfield and we get the hamsters and guinea pigs that need to be treated before Petsmart can put them on the sales floor.
"That's the probkem. It looks like they're enjoying it, when in reality they're desperately running around, looking for a cover or how to get out of it. If you ever put a hamster in aball, pay attention to where they're running to. If it's corners, under tables, basically anywhere where they could hide without the ball, then they're most likely not liking it. Plus: if they're really getting up to speed,  think about how hard it is to make a ball stop, without running it against something,  when you're inside it."
"Yeah if it's big enough then it's fine, just a lot of the time they aren't"
"Hamsters cannot see very well, they rely on scent and feeling around with their whiskers. Balls pretty much take away everything they use to get around, so they are blindly being forced to run around in a little ball. There are plenty of instances where their little toes have gotten caught and hurt in the air holes, and if kept in there long enough they will pee and poop on themselves. In Germany exercise balls have even been banned because of them being unsafe :)"
"It's stressful, terribly understimulating and bad for their body. There's literally nothing good about them."
"Just to begin with, they will poop and pee in it. Then they are covered in poop and pee when the use it."
"I put my gerbils in balls and let them run around. At first when they weren't used to it, they'd run into walls and roll around inside the balls. But then they learned coordination and got the hang of it, and now it's like they're training for the Rodent Olympics."
"Well, did you think it looked like a good idea? According to most animal-obsessed Redditors, that was your first mistake. Anything that looks like a good idea is almost undoubtedly deadly."
"FYI human hamster-balling has a name and is a thing:  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorbing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorbing) 

It can also be deadly:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1650iw/inflatable\_ball\_ride\_goes\_horribly\_wrong\_on/](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1650iw/inflatable_ball_ride_goes_horribly_wrong_on/)"

Hahaha... too cute... what happens if it puts on too much mass and get stuck inside that wheel?

Oh they're definitely torture devices with a child around. I'm not proud of it but as a kid I definitely took my hamster...for a spin.
"Oh hey, I go to Banfield for my pets! Thank you and keep up the good work, being a vet seems hard as shit"
They're also really inbred at those places. Lot's of hamsters have neurological issues due to being so inbred and people think it's just them being cute :(
You guys take care of guinea pigs? I've been looking for an exotic pet vet closer to home so I don't have to drive to Denver to find one. It'd be nice if I could just take them to the Petsmart in town.
"When I was CEM I fought against taking my animals to the Banfields because literally all they ever did was give them cutsie names, then prescribe Baytril. No way they were ever getting examined."
"As I said, he went inside on his own even with the choice of running around freely in the apartment and not because he looked for cover. And he never had troubles to make the ball stop. That thing didn't roll around on its own and it stopped on its own immediately when he stopped."
Now I feel like a piece of shit.  I used to put my pet mice in those balls when I was little.  They were feeder mice that I bought from the pet store because I didn't want them to get eaten.  They each lived to be over a year so I must have been doing something right....
"Wait, really?

My hamster loved the ball üò≤and it was big enough for him. He always went inside of it on his own and started running and knew exactly where to go in the flat. That was like 10 years ago. Didn't even knew it got banned here in Germany."
"What a load of bullshit. I've had multiple hamsters throughout life and every one of them loved the things, needed absolutely 0 encouraging to get in after they'd figured it out and would have hours of fun not running into things and being perfectly capable of sniffing through the holes. 

That's like banning dog leashes, muzzles or cages because dogs dont like them and want to run and explore freely.

I wonder how many dead hamsters in walls, couches and crawl spaces there are in germany because of this."

"On mobile you have to click the username, then view profile and the follow button will appear in the top right corner."
I got salsa on my shirt...
It will devour the wheel to freedom!
"That's how he's already thinking, you see, part of the master plan to make himself exercise.

He can't muster the self-motivation to actually do any without some external force.

Being trapped is a pretty significant external force."
We'll come back for yooooouuuu
His massively packed cheeks will trap him in first.
We get another one and tie a string to it. We put him in the wheel and let them become codependent. Then we hang on the string and rip them both out of the wheel.
You're a bad person but you're also me so...
"Thank you for your kind words, but I'm not a vet! Although, they do have a very busy job. I love the veterinarians at our hospital. I'm an assistant, soon to be technician (once I pass my licensing exam)."
"Hm I guess you could call and ask, worse they say is no! But they should offer to see your guinea pig. We get sick ones all the time that just need a little meds to get back on their feet. I wouldn't suggest Banfield for emergency care for your guinea pig, but basic care should be just fine :)"
"Yeah, mine is a larger ball for my hamster and he just follows me around the kitchen in it, he's definitely not trying to hide and if I stop moving sometimes he'll just chill next to me and sometimes he'll go explore a bit"
"Yeah! I believe it was banned a few years ago, I do believe there are some hamsters that enjoy their ball, my hamster loves getting in her coffee cup, because that‚Äôs what I use to lift her out of her enclosure :)"
"My hamster loves her ball too! As soon as I put it in her cage, she hops right in and immediately starts running around when it's closed. She definitely knows where she's going too."
"it is very controversial in the hamster community. if you‚Äôd like I can send you German research over hamster balls later on. Germany has some of the best animal rights and pet care in the world. I am not trying to say you are an awful terrible human being for using balls, just that there are obvious dangers in using them. Like I said in a response I believe hamsters can get trained to understand that ball=getting out of cage and running around. Sorry if my post came off as attacking those who use balls.

Quick edit as I didn‚Äôt see your last part, when you let hamsters free roam you first hamster proof the room to prevent injury and supervise them the entire time as you would with any animal or rodent to prevent injury. It‚Äôs not that hard to comply with proper husbandry in letting a hamster free roam for an hour as many hamster owners do. I wouldn‚Äôt compare leashes/muzzles to hamster balls, as balls extremely lolIt hamsters senses and their mobility in a way. Because they are prey animals they enjoy having the freedom to hide when they feel like they need to, balls limit that as well. As I said again it is a very controversial subject in the community, many still use balls and that‚Äôs fine. People should just understand the risks, no judgement."
"Ok, I'll just talk about how it eats its babies"
"No I don't take requests unfortunately, I always get flooded with people asking for a drawing so I've decided not to take any. I do take some commissions though."
"*gets super ripped* 
    
Check it out guys!? I figured we could use it!
    
Whats happening?
    
Its just mac, he‚Äôs fat, he‚Äôs skinny, he‚Äôs muscular. Its really a cry for help and attention."
HE‚ÄôS GOT *SALSA* ON HIS SHIRT!
Give that wheel one good spin
"Ahh still, you're doing good work haha"
Let‚Äôs not kink shame your mom
Completely understandable. We'll just have to contend with randomly being surprised by your art when visiting posts :D
"Fair enough, just had to ask!"
"""Just act surprised""

""Wow, it looks great man!""

*Look of confusion, bewilderment*"

"Tips and tricks for area 51 raiders (PLEASE SHARE THIS WITH OTHER RAIDERS)

If possible, get yourself some body armour (you don't want to die)

Get yourself some supplies: a map, wire cutters, medkits, food, lot of water (it's a fucking desert) and monster energy drinks (for all the Kyle's) and a gas mask (against tear gas)

And courage, lots and lots of courage

Stay strong"

Can't wait to respawn
What has humanity turned into-
"""You can't sleep when monsters are nearby"""
Also be sure to use your tactical insertion in case the beds don‚Äôt work
Another tip: Bring totem of undying with you so if they shoot you you won't die
Guys if we plan on breaking in it‚Äôs just gonna be a bunch of sweaty ass people in the hangers wishing they had water. It‚Äôs not about getting in it‚Äôs about getting under because that‚Äôs where it‚Äôs all at. Underground. So bring some shovels boys and girls.

Let‚Äôs make a alien red stone automated farm
Welyn come to mind.
Mind if I.... Maybe... Put my bed next to yours?
For sure
Word
"No you cant, theres monsters nearby in Area 51"
Good luck.....Aholes!
"You may not rest now,there are monsters nearby"
The bed is missing or obstructed
"Crap, I don't have any wool. Can somebody hook me up?"
The area 51 guards better not /gamemode creative on us
You assume I will die?
I'll bring extra beds in case someone forgets. Also a couple chests probably.
They can just put lava on top of the beds
We need to build a sky base to put are beds on and then elytra down
what if i put a bed down and a tactical insertion?
Xd
Don't forget /gamerule keepinventory true
Unless it‚Äôs in the nether
I checked it out on google earth as soon as the memes started rolling in ..damn they made some of the planes so blurry not able to view them properly..
The Kyle's got the slow falling Monster potions to take out the towers and quicky jump off
Tactical Insertion activated
also make sure to set keepinventory to true
What if the people of the area 51 react because of all the Memes and hide the aliens elsewhere?
Thus implying we have to die prior to respawn there? Can‚Äôt complain
I‚Äôm bringing the tnt cannons
LMFAO
Thank you for reminding them
On it
Nice
"You can‚Äôt sleep yet, there are monsters nearby"
Set spawn
Yes sir
And surround them with obsidian so the IBF can‚Äôt destroy them
I tried to sleep in the nether once
remember that you cant sleep cause there will be enemies nearby
Ooo
"If monsters are nearby, just change the mode to creative and get a diamond sword fire aspect and kill them"
Until some idiot removes them!
There are monsters nearby
"Also bring some soul sand and some wither skulls, to deploy withers, because they can absorb a lot of damage and will give the guards the withering effect."
you may not rest now there are monsters nearby
And don‚Äôt forget to set keep inventory
"What if I put my bed down next to yours Haha just joking
Unless?"
"**You may not rest now, there are ayylmaos nearby**"
"But make sure you don't put yours inside the fence, for there are monsters nearby."
Bruh just change /worldspawn
But we are in hardcore mode
What if they destroy the beds?
Air mattresses if you want a speed advantage over the gaurds.
It‚Äôs big brain time
"Not gonna happen. There‚Äôs no way you could get 500,000+ people to lay down at the same time"
What if it says- *you can't sleep now there are monsters nearby*
Also don't forget to bring A LOT OF WATER AND SUNBLOCK OR YOU WILL LITERALLY BURN TO A CRISP OUT THERE!
Guys don't do it!!!! Area 51 doesn't have aliens..... They are trying to protect us from HEROBRINE!!!!!!!!!!! He's in there!!!!!!!! Don't release him!!!!!
That looks like gta5 fort zancudo
Make sure to get your potions ready before you leave.
"no, the guards will destroy our beds so that we can't respawn"
"Guys we just need to build a nether hub which links to the middle of area 51, this means aliens have an escape tunnel"
That‚Äôs a great idea!
Its hot like hell there so maybe consider to not do that *cough* nether
My guys REMEMBER TRAVEL THROUGH THE NETHER SO WE CAN BUILD OUR EXIT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BASE!
But isn‚Äôt Area 51 a different dimension
Much appreciated
The minecraft battalion (Redstone engineers not included) were told to do this for everyone. This because the Kyles can't really act on the ground from their monster helicopters.
Don‚Äôt forget to bring your home tele tabs for that ornate pool regen
But Area 51 is like the end so the beds will just blow up
What about the monsters nearby?
Pls dont spawn snipe
*you cannot rest when enemies are nearby*
Flip I forgot about doing that
Why don‚Äôt we dig a base under Area 51 and that‚Äôs were we put the beds and the weapons so that way they will never expect us bursting from the ground.
No that‚Äôs a terrible idea they will just explode
"Tries to sleep in bed: There are aliens nearby

EVERYBODY AT THE RAID: HELL YEAH"
Gamer
"I like how all the beds are red.

Just how they should be."
"You idiots,the beds need to be colored so you know who‚Äôs is who‚Äôs"
/spawnpoint
You can‚Äôt sleep because of the secret monsters within Area 51
Can't sleep there are monsters around
Plenty of sand biome
What if bed blown up?
That‚Äôs why it is set during night time
#YOUR BED WAS MISSING OR OBSTRUCTED
We need welyn on the team he raids rust bases by himself.
r/Minecraft
"place walls, the guards can't spawn in front of player placed walls."
But what if it's in the nether
"People about to storm area 51: They cant stop us all
Area 51 gaurd: *laughs in 3000 rounds per minutes*"
Also don't forget to bring ender pearls to get over the guards
We can just use creative mode and get some spawn eggs
"What if i put my bed next to yours? Haha just kidding, unlesssss???"
"Repost smh 

https://twitter.com/wheresjulianlol/status/1149990332454408193?s=21

Still an amazing meme"
*Bed was missing or obstructed*
"Anyone else really fucking tired of area 51 and time traveler memes?? I'm so done, it was completely overdone in not even an hour, and it still persists"
oh yeah nahui best strategy
"Not to be overdramatic, but if I see one more ""area 51 meme haha"" I'm going to fucking scream."
"Seriously though, area 51 is an air Force Base for the testing of aircraft that could get mistaken for UFOs. It's not like an umbrella Corp laboratory or Black Mesa or whatever."
If anyone puts their bed next to mine they are big gay. Unless it‚Äôs a chick then allowed. üê•I always wanted one.
its only comrades nearby
You can just set spawnpoint lol.
"Question: There were once three frogs on a log and on of them made a decision to jump in. How many were left? Answer: There are still three frogs on a log, he only made a decision, he took no action."
We need to set world spawn point there.
Then we‚Äôll need to head to the overworld nevada and place down our beds around the nether portal we‚Äôll build there
Op is an Area 51 guard confirmed
We can use the beds as weapons then!
so we replace the beds of the guards with them. perfect.
We can use them to blow up the base
Plot twist: They're Terraria beds and don't explode at all
If it's outside the base it's safe
JuSt jOiN a cuRSed mInecraFt serVer aNd sleEp iN netHer beSIDe waTEr
Then use the beds as weapons
"Then we‚Äôll use the beds to blow up the walls and get in there, easier."
cup
If we use world cheats we can do /setworldspawn but we need an admin ü§î
"If so, we can link up a nether portal and bypass the security"
At least is 8x faster to get there
Exactly what I was about to say
Spotted the FBI agent
even better we can use the beds to explode the walls and infiltrate in the base
OP clearly government man. Only confirming the Nether Dragon rests inside.
Does that mean the alien we are all eager to see could actually be an Enderman?ü§î
Killed by intentional design
"Thank you, many would have lost their lives without you"
"m8 they have their stuff in the nether, but the portal to get there is heavily guarded in Area 51. To ensure success, those remaining must place down their beds far enough from aliens to sleep, so we can respawn outside the portal."
The guards are pillagers and the tanks are ravengers
Great tip! We should build another portal after looting
And you can't sleep while monsters are nearby
We need someone to replicate area 51 on thier private server so we understand where to go.
ARK player translation: Bring some tames with platform saddles with beds (preferably bunk beds due to decreased cooldown) as well as some other tames to defend them. Don't forget explosives or rading dinos.
Dont forget to invite the stash man :)
and bring some loud kids
And we need welyn
do a fortnut translation. you'll get the 13 year old army's attention more that way
"""you can't sleep now, there are monsters nearby"" (monster energy can rolls down the hill) (is then able yo get in bed) someone watching my attempt to be funny: 

&#x200B;

what"
"And chorus fruit, to tp in the base"
I hope the engineers close up the portal before you all get to it and mess up the perimeter that keeps the portal beasts in check
But only they have the permission!!
"A lot of them have been pretty good imo

Or maybe its just because im used to the shitty nobody memes"
Minecraft good
I think I don‚Äôt get this one. Game reference?
You need 3 wool and red dye so it looks good
The KGB special ops team in order to take advantage of stupid people
We need a new wave that stays behind to cover the beds
Enderchest is best
Do you think you can sleep in the alien dimension though
What?

r/unexpectedcommunism
If we wanted to cheat we would just /tp. Cheating is for losers!
Wow u/WisestWiseman909 you really are wise
username checks out
Bring command blocks then
"Even better, it‚Äôll link to the nether portal inside Area 51. We won‚Äôt even have to fight our way inside."
do /spawnpoint
"GUYS NETHER PORTAL INTO AREA 51, WE JUST HAVE TO GO TO THE NETHER AND BUILD THE RETURN PORTAL IN THE RIGHT PLACE"
It‚Äôs a trick. Send no reply
Area 51 houses the op of the server
"Carefully, he's a hero"
It's a surprise tool that will help us later
But then you need to build a house for them to work
Welyn reference?
It was the start of a cool fresh day in rust...
Just undermesh them that's what all the cool people do smh
If surge and wilsonater come we will be unstoppable

there is only ""we"""
But we will be...
"Remember, no russian"
But who else is gonna hack the security mainframe?
r/expectedcommunism for balance
Area 51 has the command blocks
Let‚Äôs give em to Sethbling
We would need to bring some locator maps tho to see where the aliens are
8 blocks to 1 baby
"Once we gain console access, we can get ourselves OP, and download whatever plugins we want."
We'll all go down as heroes in history.
They‚Äôre not beds they‚Äôre surprise mechanics
Just build a giant house then
That made it worse
"No you fucking walnut, it's clearly terraria 4. Dumb people these days."
As all things should be
Just remove operator permission from the area 51 guards
What if Area 51 has barrier blocks around it so we can‚Äôt get inside.
"""hey guys so I've been working on this quantum computer made using command blocks"""
/kill area51guard
"It's from Mickey Mouse, you swine."
Why? they must already have one or the aliens would move out. just place it in there.
I agree
Especially these days
As nothing should be (for balance)
they hosted it from dedicated console and we dont have access to it
/killall
We have creative mode
"""and its pretty simple, just a couple armor stands"""
I see you're a man of culture as well
What are you talking about
Switch the host then
/kill @a
"""It's a surprise tool that will help us later,"" is from Mickey Mouse Clubhouse."
Yeah but they themselves are hosting it.
/kill @e lets not forget the aliens
"/kill @a ![Aliens, A51Raiders]"
"Guys, im friends with the admin of the server all7.continents.net. i have admin so all I have to so is go into creative mode and kill all the guards"
Why make Xisuma the host and he can take care of all the admin duties
no the whole point is to see them aliens so we can't kill them!
"We cant sacrifice every living being, including animals, to die within our render distance!"

What if.. the alien is Madara?
"I enjoyed this, well played"
He is missing because he isn't using a big metal piston spike.
That last wiggle killed meüòÇüòÇ
"LMAO. In all seriousness though. I always thought Ali and his opponent were on on his ducks and played it off together. Why go for the head when his body was wide open?? A few clean shots to the kidney and night night.

Finally. Somebody had captured the reality of this phenomenon

Mohammed Ali is unparalleled in the game
That is the all time best move
Jolly good show
This is why I always use chopsticks when eating salad lol
Like I understand going for the head to try n get a knockout. But a well place body shot would have done more damage. N made that extra headshot easier to hit.
That's when I'd get overly frustrated and bite the ear off the tomato
"Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, dodge like a cherry tomato"
I can't stand cherry tomatoes in my salad. They pop like cysts in your mouth. Makes my skin crawl.
These DeepFakes are getting out of hand.
"Lol Ali was so cocky, but he could back it up. I love watching his fights."
"[Hey, I made this. I'd appreciate it if you came by my channel and checked it out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYY_2EZuD-E)"
Ali was savage with that wiggle at the end
I laughed a little too much at this post.
That's when you give up and just use a spoon
tomatoes are for old people and fascists
The cherry or an olive. The Olive tires me..
Just use a big metal piston spike

This was a demetri martin stand up bit.
Where the fuck is the ref? You can't hit in the corner.
"gave me an idea, perhaps one side of them should be scored just a little bit, it they were less perfectly round they wouldnt slide around as much and also the dressing could penetrate into the tomato and enhance the flavours."
Something I've never experienced. First thing I do is throw those fuckers out of my salad.
I really wanna get to the main course for fuck sake
Dang it! I thought I took all those out and threw them away!
I feel like it‚Äôs EVERY cherry tomato in my salad >.<

Wow finally some OC thanks!
When did facebook migrate here
Especially if the dressing has oil in it
The worst part is the scraping of the metal fork on the plate
Man this so accurately conveys the battle of the last tomato
"Then you give up and pick it up with your hand, lol"
I feel personally punched.
I used to never like cherry tomatoes until I tried home grown ones. they were amazing
The struggle
The frustration
That wiggle tho
After finally getting a hold of it and looking up victorious only to see everyone starring at you because a cherry tomato almost outsmarted you.
Thats why i dont eat salad
"Hasn't this already been posted before?
Real question because I've seen this before"

I enjoyed seeing a visual joke that was done with visuals instead of just spreading a paragraph of text over a picture
"Not enough taunt at the end, but otherwise I enjoyed it too."
Hijacked the top to share my technique; I like a bit of everything in every bite so I always cut the tomatoes in half which is not hard with a sharp knife. The flat side of the cut tomatoes is way easier to stab with your fork and now you'll have more tomato in each bite. I get that cutting your salad may seem weird but you'll feel like a boss when you can taste everything in the salad in every bite you take.
Every. Damn. Time.

Beat me to it
"Yeah, he was a huge showoff in the ring. He was the best in the world and knew it and made sure he showed it to everyone, including the people trying to kill him."
Kills me every time it‚Äôs reposted
I knew it! I knew it! The tomatoes are doing on purpose!
"Why didnt the other dude nail him in the gut? Or throw punches with both arms so he couldnt dodge? I guess rules...

Also if he wasnt holding on to the ropes he wouldnt be able to move like that."
This was an exhibition fight so you're probably right.
"Once he missed a few he probably though ""right, fuck you. I'm going to get your fucking face of it's the last thing I do!"""
Go for the body and you leave your own head wide open for a ko.
Ali was taunting Foreman saying he couldn‚Äôt hit him in the head and then he used his strategy of leaning on the ropes to dodge his punches more efficiently while tiring him out.
"The first time I read this comment, I thought to myself, ‚ÄúWtf do waterfowl have to do with any of this? And why do they both know about said waterfowl?‚Äù"
">Why go for the head when his body was wide open??

Because his head was also wide open?"
It‚Äôs not night night it‚Äôs painful but he wouldn‚Äôt be done
Not this instance but in general. Dont you get more points if you hit head. Not all fights ends in ko.
Surprised u didnt get downvoted for pointing this out
This seems fake.
Iirc he bet the guy he couldnt get a clean chin hit on him.
Presumably the ref is supposed to break it up if someone is in the corner like that if this were a serious fight.
An open headshot with hands on the ropes.    you aren't going for the belly.
"He knew that ali trained his stomach enough so that he wouldnt be hurt by punching it, thats why he was aiming for the head."
You mean liver? Aren't kidney shots illegal?
I see you're a man of culture as well.
"You know when you see a post and know that you have the perfect response, and then check the comments and nobody has posted it yet?

Yeah, me neither."
"Respect, you were first"
I didn't even click the link but I'm pretty sure I know what it is.. does it involve a stabby AI?
Never seen this dudes videos before but his mastery of cutting shots prematurely to make jokes funnier is laudable. How long til we see a potty-mouthed maker collab between this kid and Simone Giertz?
i know its made by the sake of fuck with shit for fun but grab a glove then catch those red globes.

"It's cause it is an exhibition match, meaning it was more for fun/show than being serious at all."
It's was a setup like the WWE.

Fork off...
"I think the fork work could've been better tbh, the tomato on the other hand."
Holy forking shirt balls
"Source video for the lazy:

https://youtu.be/TlpzvUm4F1k?t=12"
Half a cherry tomato might take over the bite less than a full one. Get a cherry tomato in a bite of salad and as soon as you bite into it you just have a bunch of tomato in your mouth.
so...very much like the perfect egg bite? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktVIQZ7tiag
"I cut out the middleman altogether and don't put salad in my tomatoes. Seriously, I fucking love tomatoes. I will eat a whole bowl, plate or crate of tomatoes."
Why is cutting your salad weird. Do you put whole cucumbers in your salad?
I use a similar technique where I put the cherry tomatoes on the table and smash them with a closed fist hammer strike.
"""Excuse me, ma'am? When you have a minute, could I get a salad knife?"""
And you can actually season them properly once they are cut.

"I think this was an exhibition match, which generally had worked spots for entertainment."
Him standing over Foreman instead of throwing that finishing punch is my favorite.
Still very impressive. Those are still real punches.
C'mon you don't just windmill at his torso. You pepper in a shot or two. C'mon.
"Hi, have you ever heard of our Lord Dempsey and his Roll?"
Yikes... Let's leave the analysis to people that know anything about boxing please. Who's getting KO'd when his hands are on the damn ropes? Give me a break...
This is from his exhibition match with Michael Dokes. Did he do the same thing in a match with Foreman though? I wouldn't be surprised.
Isn't hanging on to the ropes completely illegal as well?
Heads are harder to hit....
https://youtu.be/gTHESiGooFY
Many years of playing WoW as a rogue have taught me that Kidney Shot stuns.
"I believe kidney shots are illegal in american boxing, if not worldwide.  The punch shown in the clip below is a liver shot."
Kidney and liver shots hurt for twelve seconds... Just long enough for most fighters to get counted out. Plenty of KOs happen like that.
"10 points must system. If you look like you‚Äôre fucking the guy up regardless of whether youre hitting the head or body, your gonna get 10-9 in your favor"

Wrong.  Ali was well known for his quick reflexes and wearing a giant tomato on his head.
The tomato was done in photoshop
Meanwhile this one is real: [mike tyson](https://media.giphy.com/media/9jtBEYakVpOLe/giphy-downsized-large.gif)

"Yeah I worded that poorly. Instead of having a full cherry tomato every couple bites, when cutting them in half or quarters you'll be able to have enough in the bowl to get some tomato goodness in every bite. Full cherry tomato definitely takes over the palette when you get one. You taste more with smaller pieces!"
"Thats why I use these bad bois

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomberry"
"I mean like if I'm ordering a salad when out, I'll ask for a knife as well. I don't even need a diced salad, I just like the bigger stuff a little more cut up than the restaurants seem to make it. Then I can get all the ingredients with each bite."
"Honestly I can't think of anyone else who comes close. Mike Tyson? Michael Jordan? Larry Bird? All legends, but just not on Ali's level."
"I think Homer Simpson is a good man. I like him. I got nothing against him, but I'm definitely gonna make orphans of his children"
You really have to wonder if this wasn't completely staged. His arms are 100% holding the ropes and exposing his midsection. The opposing boxer had a free shot to any part of this mans mid section and never even considered throwing that shot? Ali never even acts like he cares about protecting his mid section.
What exhibition match was this?
That dude who was missing went on to become heavy weight champion later on lol
But if the guy was in on it then he‚Äôs missing intentionally so it doesn‚Äôt matter how ‚Äúreal‚Äù they are
"C‚Äômon man, tell em C‚Äômon"
Dont tell me how to windmill
Muhammad Ali though. This ain‚Äôt just anyone you‚Äôre talking about. It‚Äôs not a couple body shots and night night. This is a man who fought 6 rds with a broken jaw. He was hit hundreds of times by some of the hardest hitters of all time and very rarely did they effect him.
"Think about kiting and drawing aggro where you want it. If you make him feel like he has a good chance to end the fight and take you down a few pegs in one hit, he‚Äôll keep going for it."
"""You should never take body shots""

That guy, apparently"
"It‚Äôs not illegal. The only thing I can think you might be thinking of is that if you use the ropes as a way to stop yourself from being knocked down, the ref can rule a knockdown at his discretion."
But much more satisfying
I stand corrected
"Holy crap, just pops him and walks away to wait. What a boss"
[Der liver punch](https://gfycat.com/seriousplayfulkillifish)  (Bas ruptures the guys liver with this punch)
Isn't that a liver punch though?
That's a punch to the liver. Kidney punches are to the back.
"How is this a kidney punch. It's clearly a liver punch. Infact, if I'm correct, straight kidney punches are illegal in boxing...?"
"Oh, I ain‚Äôt to good at knowing which is which"
I always thought the tomato was a weird choice but to each their own
It was an exhibition and this part was staged
Nah that's way too real for Photoshop.
"Impossible, photoshop didn't exist back then."
Oh ok
"> I love little flavor explosions in my mouth

"Larry Bird fs, he has a lot of great stories.

If you have 10 minutes in your day [watch this](https://youtu.be/K5o1rd09R1Q)"
"You know, they do have a mother, Champ."
"A reminder that we're talking about Muhammed Ali here... normal boxing technique doesn't exactly apply. For example, he takes a number of open mid-section punches from Joe Frazier (who packed a hell of a punch) but Ali knew it before it happened. He took it, but moves in close with his head/upper body as he gets the first pinch in. To him, it's a calculated risk... the man holds his Legendary title for a reason.

https://youtu.be/YjbxoiUBR50"
Kept thinking the same thing.  A sternum or liver shot to a guy with his arms spread like that would end the fight pretty much instantly.
"Muhammad Ali vs. Michael Dokes in 1977. You should be able to find footage of the match on youtube.

It's worth nothing that Ali was 35 at the time, and Dokes was 19 and fairly new to professional boxing, but also something of a rising star. In his amateur career, he received the silver medal in the Pan American Games in 1975 and had won the Golden Gloves Heavyweight Championship in 1976. He was undefeated in his professional non-exhibition matches well beyond this exhibition match. His first actual loss was in 1983. He had two draws in 1980 and 1983 respectively."
C'mon man he has a point man C'mon
Yeah you tell them u/StinkyDickFaceRapist
"Huh thanks. I figured it was the same as in UFC where obviously you can't use the cage to your advantage by pushing off it or pulling yourself up by it.   
Thanks for the info!"
Liver shot hurts more than any blow to the waist up that I can possibly imagine by like 100x
"If you wanna keep standing correct, follow r/MMA"
That guy on the floor isn‚Äôt Ali.
Roy Jones Jr. has more than one of those types of KO's.
"I thought maybe that first one did it, but dude kept fighting, then I saw that last lightning-fast left hook where he immediately drops. 

It took me a couple of loops to actually catch it. Scary shit."
"Heh, it's all good.  Assuming you're human (and not Vulcan or something like that),  your kidneys are in your lower back and your liver is at the top of your gut on the right side and middle, just below and I think partially behind the ribs."

"You seem like you know about boxing. Can you help me understand the rules? Seems like whenever Frasier started making some contact, Ali would just wrap him up."
I don't disagree that Ali was amazing. Watching any of his mega fights with Frasier or Foreman can prove that.  But in this instance I **think** it was possibly a prearranged publicity stunt.
I thought there was a rule against it or something.
"Very informative, thanks!"

"Oh, okay. Thanks."
why are kidney shots illegal but liver shots allowed?
"Mr Lahey I thought we agreed, no more shit talk until we're back in charge."
Ogres have layers
"I love the part where merchant keeps asking him a question and mike stops for a second and said 

‚ÄúI dunno man.‚Äù I love how pissed mike was for that second 

I love this rant"
"Nope. Boxing wisdom says you work the body, because if you take that out, the rest goes with it. In a clinch, you can‚Äôt punch the kidneys or throw ‚Äúrabbit punches,‚Äù which is a punch thrown like how you would pound a table. Eating a dude‚Äôs ear is also not permitted."
"Oh yeahs there‚Äôs a few mma fights where one clean liver shot puts the opponent on the ground and the guy doesn‚Äôt even jump on him cuz he knows it‚Äôs over. Most of the time they do and hit the head a few times until ref stops them, but almost half heartedly because they knew."
"Not a knock out, but you can‚Äôt keep fighting. It‚Äôs a TKO. He‚Äôs in so much pain he can‚Äôt continue."
"Oh yeah man, well I dont HOPE you find out, but at some point it's bound to happen, so just protect yourself best you can. I've seen a few more than I'd like. And it's never immediate. You see the shot land. Then both fighters kind of wait a sec, and you see the agony slowly crease the face of the victim, and he/she usually folds up, if not back up immediately. Definitely dont want to be on the receiving end of any internal damage."
"Probably because a kidney shot is clearly hitting someone in the back to cause internal damage, whereas the liver is in the front of the body and (partially) protected by the ribs."
I listen to it every once in a while.
"> Eating a dude‚Äôs ear is also not permitted.

But very tempting."
"[And then there's Sell v Smith, which defies all logic.](https://youtu.be/kT8iLiorubU)"

AHEM AHEM FACE BOOK STARTED THIS SHIT !!
It was started on Facebook though. Reddit doesn't want to admit that Facebook finally made a meme first.
Exept facebook was first
"Facebook will come first, then Reddit, then instegram."
Facebook was first tho
You do understand that the event has nothing to do with Reddit?? It's a Facebook event .. fucking Reddit always thinking they're the entirety of the internet
Lol reddit is already late to the party and you claim the place om the raid? Lol
This started as a Facebook event you Redditeur normie.
"*I‚Äôm from the future, you got into hot*"
"oh, yes, it was all reddit idea all along"
Never thought we'll be joining hands from the other side. Negotiations are necessary for this inevitable task. All hail shaggy! Let's get them aliens.
"It‚Äôs a Facebook event, not a Reddit event."
This shit started in facebook. Reddit just got on the train like ig.
"Actually Facebook will be first, not Reddit."
It's a Facebook event lmao
but facebook start this meme
This is way funnier than it got credit for lol
It‚Äôs ironic because Facebook shitposters started this meme
It literally started on Facebook though
Except this is literally a fucking Facebook meme. Normies made this not us.

"This whole area 51 thing reminds me of the dark Knight.  When that nerd wants to out Bruce Wayne and Lucious was just like, if what you are saying is true, good luck.

Let's say Bob Lazar isn't nuts and what he says is true (his story has some very compelling arguments).  Think of the evolution of man made energy.  Humans started with wood and have progressed to splitting the atom.  Little Man, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima had a payload of about 140lbs of uranium-235.  But it was extremely inefficient, roughly 1.5% of it fissioned.  2.5 lbs of uranium caused that much damage.

Now, imagine if humans started out with this as our first energy source.  Fission to aliens may be like steam power for us.  If BL is credible and the aliens manipulate spacetime to travel, that means they can essentially be everywhere and nowhere at the same time.  Maybe aliens are quarks and gluons."
Oh no they are the same
Are people actually going to try to invade area 51 and if so do they know they will probably fail
It's even spreading to Twitter now. The army is growing...
Ecs dee
[removed]
We must unite
one week earlier facebook arrives
 We must have a attack plan. This is how I would raid it I would bring tannerite and sugar rockets fire and you fire the rockets on one side so people go and check it out and then hit the wall with large amounts of tannerite. If you need to make it better use gunpowder or dynamite witch can be bought or made. Have tanks of mustard gas (bleach and vinegar) so you lay down suppressive fire and run car with napalm (gas and soap) at the gate after you light it the guards run and you take the automatic weapons. You hit the place with homemade grenades. Just small shells of sheet metal with gunpowder inside and a fuse on top. You can buy large rolls of Kevlar for 3D printing and you can print out vests and helmets. You can raid the shelters with tannerite and the key cards from the guards. Or as a other option there is a uranium mine 2 hrs from my house so that‚Äôs an option

"LPT: Pouring water on a tear gas canister can nullify or lessen the effects depending on the type of canister used. The main component of riot grade tear gas is actually a powder commonly called [CS powder](http://www.dayuchemical.com/cs-powder/CS_Powder_Introduction.html). This powder is harmless at room temperature but heating it causes the chemical reaction that it‚Äôs so well known for. There is a pyrotechnic charge in the canister that heats said powder. If you have tear gas thrown directly at you and don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to run due to the crowd or other factors, take out your water bottle and drown the hell out of the canister. This can stop the pyrotechnic charge from being set off. Be safe cheek clappers.

Edit: also in the case that you are gassed, BLINK MOTHERFUCKER, as much as you want to keep your eyes sealed when tear gas gets in them (source: me) blinking will help flush the chemical from your eyes. Also, for the love of Christ, don‚Äôt touch your eyes or your nose with your hands, no matter how badly you‚Äôd like to wipe away the obscene amount of tears and snot running down your face. When you‚Äôre clear of the gas, remove unnecessary clothing and then rinse yourself as much as possible with COLD water, this will both rinse some of the chemical off and help keep you cool, in turn keeping your pores closed and more chemicals out."

I don‚Äôt think so. Facebook is *at least* 5 years behind us. When was last time minion memes were dank?
I forgot
A millenium later...internet explorer users
They are actually better than reddit these days
Or vagana
"not to mention that regardless of which social media hears about the raid (before september 20), they are all going to be told that the raid takes place on september 20, so they wouldn't be late."
How did Facebook start this event?
Shit should've known
"except they were meming from the start, the original mentioned naruto running to outrun their bullets and alien coochie"
Fb memers started the whole thing lmaoo
"I mean, in the description they mentioned naruto running to dodge the bullets and to see them aliens, so im pretty sure it wasnt a serious thing"
It was started by a meme page
Uhh it was started by 2 people with meme names and they made a satirical plan.
"Dude did you even look at the event page that started it???? It's literally created by a user who has the word ',shitposting' in it...

People here are stupid af lol"
Fine choice of words monsuier
But why would the reddit meme-ers be the one raiding and not the serious fb-er
Have you even seen the event...? The page that created is called ‚ÄúShitposting cause I‚Äôm in shambles‚Äù it‚Äôs been a meme from the start and it started on Facebook.
Nigga delete this you're embarrassing yourself
Ya sure its serious? They said they were gonna naruto run their way to Area 51
You're retarded
Never
"Honestly there are some dank parts of Facebook. People give it a lot more shit than it deserves. And I‚Äôm a guy who uses FB, Reddit, and 4chan"
Lol if you follow the right pages there‚Äôs 100x danker shit than Reddit‚Äôs circlejerky memes like ‚ÄúYOURE BREATHTAKING üò©üëåüèº‚Äù
r/wackytictacs is lit af
Facebook literally started the meme
No comrade... we forgot
Whichever will it be
the page for the event was made on Facebook and went viral on Facebook

naruto running is a requirement just for gatekeeping. You dont want the Chads going in with weaponized sports equipment or the Tanners going in with actual weapons.

"Wait, are we the normies?"
"Did not look at it, my first bad comment and I apologize for my misunderstanding, I still kinda knew about it being a joke but the ""[Some number] people signed up"" got me confused even tho I still kinda knew it was a joke. Again, I am sorry and I have not necessarily checked it that you are saying ""people here are fucking stupid"". Would have given the message even if you did not say that."
I cleared that in my edit
[removed]
"Uh I am not, nobody is for just one comment like that. Except you are a loser sitting on his ass all day and hating on literally everything and insulting people rather than simply pointing out the mistake"
interesting
"I use 4Chan, too. Some of the funniest things I‚Äôve seen are there."
I guess Facebook gets a bad wrap when it comes to memes bc many Redditors don't bother to join the dank closed groups
"I agree, there are many dank groups I see original, quality memes that later on are posted on reddit"

"go to boards other than /b/. /b/ is cancer and has been nothing but porn for a while now.

You know we'll be the guy on the right soon enough
Wait there are *serious* people in this raid
Been seriously thinking about this. What if when/if we actually break in there‚Äôs nothing inside area51 because the governments relocated everything after hearing about the plan. It‚Äôs literally all over social media.
Yes! We need more Rango format memes

"Tips and tricks for area 51 raiders

If possible, get yourself some body armour, helmets, kneepads. Also, bring some cars and vans. Any bit of protection helps.

Get yourself some supplies: a map, wire cutters, medkits, food and lot of water (it's a fucking desert) and a firearm with lots of bullets

Also fireworks or explosives so we can distract the soldiers and/or set them on fire

And courage, lots and lots of courage

Stay strong"

More Rango formats yay
"Everyone is focused on going to area 51. But for what reason? They think that they're gonna find aliens or some other cool shit. But the truth may be what we least expect, but what we want the most. The government made the first area 51 memes about aliens so that's all we would be focused on. No no no, we shouldn't overlook what many actually be the truth. Area 51 is hiding something, and I think I know what it is. 

They are hiding the purest version of Kid Cudi humming non-stop. And the reason that this makes sense is because our army is so powerful and this is obviously where they would get there power and motivation.

TL;DR   the government doesn't want us to know that what's actually in area 51 is kid cudi humming nonstop."
Only 340 miles away from me should I make a visit

Seriously more rango memes. Criminally under rated
It only takes one bullet to storm area 51
I‚Äôm prepared to die
i'm willing to die
MAshallah alhamdulillah Inshallah better
how many people are willing to die
"Area 51 is 575 square miles with over 2000 miles of fencing. The US/Mexico border is 1952 miles long.
So you withdraw the troops to strategic locations and protect buildings. You block the road at Indian Springs, and stop all traffic on US95 from Vegas to the Amargosa Valley cut off and surface roads.
At that point they'll to have to walk or use off road vehicles for miles to even get close in the blazing desert facing dehydration and heat death.
They will never get close and they are idiots if they think it's possible"
"Rango is criminally underrated. Just saying.  
Loads better than 'Secret Life of Pets' dogshit."
I don't understand all this talk about area 51. What happened?
What movie is that again?
Masterpiece.
Movie?
Im the guy who‚Äôs willing to die
half these people dont even think its possible

I agree. The government shouldn't have the right to keep any secrets or treat its own citizens like enemies
"Yes, a bunch of nerds from Reddit going after Area 51 is totally a great premise and foothold to enact real change lmao."
"The fact is they won't mow down thousands of people, the power of the government derives from them and their taxes, the government needs us in theory all you have to do is make a big statement to remind them"
hell ya brother

So best way is to storm into highly guarded military base:D goddamn you americans
"Once we‚Äôre done with Area 51, we should storm the concentration camps on the border like it‚Äôs 1945."
I‚Äôve watched Snowden too!
"A good foothold is storming a highly secured military facility for no good fucking reason? That's going to facilitate change? Getting arrested and/or shot while trying to accomplish nothing important?

Awesome, I hope you're the first one to hop the fence."
DANK
Thanks m8
From a great movie
"> a small militia's worth of doomsday prepper types that show up with a ton of weapons willing to actually fight the military

It's alright, Area 51 will do the standard procedure when these types of incident occur: they'll dress up as aliens, take out the flying saucer, beam them all up, drug them, keep them semi-conscious while anally probing them, then dump them randomly all over a nearby city between 0001 and 0400 hours local and they'll be completely naked.  The Smoking Man may even chuckle at the whole thing."
"People have gotten killed trying to break into Area 51 in the past. I really hope most people on here don't go. While one might find some poetic sense of Darwinistic justice from young people doing life-threatening stuff for memes like eating tide pods or literally trying to attack one of the *most secretive bases of the strongest military on the planet*, I'd rather not see anyone die for something so stupid.

I mean seriously, a lot of people might think that this is a joke, or that they can go and get arrested and escorted away for some internet points, but the base literally has signs up that say deadly force is authorized, a fact that has been proven correct before. I don't find this whole thing funny at all, I think it's extremely dangerous."
"It worked on the Lexington green, didn‚Äôt it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"They need another ingenious nut job like that guy who modified a bulldozer with concrete armor,  sight cameras and a fresh air circulation method to come up with something to break in.  That guy was motivated by revenge though."
Who do you think started the meme?
One of my favorites
"Is it though? Or just underwatched. People suck that movie‚Äôs schlong all the time (on this site), the animation and acting are great but it‚Äôs pretty dry, and can‚Äôt seem to decide whether or not it‚Äôs a kid‚Äôs movie. 

It‚Äôs absolutely good, but people act as though it‚Äôs under-recognition was a fluke: it wasn‚Äôt."
"There's always a 1/10 group of people that takes shit way to serious 

Considering it's 300k ""signed"" 
That's a serious 30k of armed badasses rolling in still"
"Apparently there are people who read that there's an event hosted by a Facebook page called ""Shitposting Because I'm In Shambles"" that says things like ""If we Naruto run, we can move faster than their bullets."" and thinks ""Yeah, this is a legitimate revolutionary movement that I want to be part of."""
Area 51 has been high-profile for decades now. It's been suspected by historians and analysts for a long time that most important projects there have been relocated as a result.

This sounds about right...
Bruh facts Agent Mulder gonna creeping the entire time
"This is what I've been saying this entire time. Its not a joke. People could very well be killed if they try getting in there. These soldiers basically don't exist and they wont be held accountable. They'd just be doing their job. 

A little bit of history about the base: I forget the exact number but at LEAST dozens of people if not many more died from some chemical they were exposed to while working at the base that gave them cancer. Their doctors were baffled and when they asked if they could know what chemical it was so they could better treat their illness they were told that there was no chemical and those people did not work on any variety of military base. The matter was taken to court. It was there that military officials were forced to acknowledge the existence of the base for the very first time, however, they were still unable to divulge any information about the chemicals or the work being done there. The workers subsequently died of their unknown illness. The courts upheld the military's prerogative to keep the bases secrets a secret even at the expense of these people's lives."
"I believe the government will be ready in some manner, either in heavier riot police-like forces instead of the few deadly defenders they have set up, or by somehow letting people ""tour"" the place (or at least within what they want us to see and shit)."
If enough people show up they can‚Äôt stop all of us!
"yeah well that was when the average citizen and the military we nearly equally armed. These days, the military would barley have to lift a finger to deal with a few thousand people attempting to storm a base."
"I think it was a movie for adults with a kids movie as the front for an excuse for adults to see and weird animated movie like that. Think of it, if it was advertised as a movie for adults who would‚Äôve ever watched it? But if parents have to take their kids to see it they‚Äôll love it, even if the kids are eh. It came out when I was a child and I still loved it then tho, so beats me."
"It's not a ""kids movie"", for sure.  It's a mature movie that is also appropriate enough for family viewing, and this doesn't detract from the experience.  And of course it's fucking dry it's in the desert."
even 300 would be a fucking headline

In my opinion Area 51 is almost certainly a base which tests spy planes. Big open areas for a start which you can fly in. Any UFO might be a secret spy plane and of course they would hide such details because they don‚Äôt want anyone to know how good their spy planes are.
Thanks brother
The rango format üôèüôèüôè
I mean like a lot of people that I know says the movie it‚Äôs rlly bad but I think it‚Äôs pretty good

"Rango: Unchained

Edit: Rango 2: Electric Boogaloo will suffice too"
###yee yee
Rango the Pre-Sequel.
BRING RANGO TO BRAZIL
"It's a great movie. It takes the all too dead-horse-beaten Western genre, as well as the usually cutesy way of showing animal based movies, and flips both on its heads. Gritty, amazing detail with a focus on natural asymmetry instead of the usual perfect depiction when animating animals, and a story that focuses on finding ones self instead of just being a run of the mill Western. Whole heartedly recommend it."
It's not a bad movie..
It won the Oscar of best animated film.
"Think a spaghetti western, but also challenging everything people expect from ""animal movies."""
It's a fucking excellent movie.
I didn't like it. The characters are gross looking and the story is stupid.
"History will be written, history never dies"
Die like the 500k people stroming it.
"Nope. It‚Äôs honestly stupid lol. More clear for newer players I guess, and you don‚Äôt need to remember numbers now"
THAT'S WHAT I SAID!
As long as you don't get me killed go right ahead bud
"I‚Äôd say I‚Äôm with you, but you‚Äôre more than likely a government plant.  If you want to discuss further, meet me at the first park bench to the right at the Park Avenue 72nd street entrance of Central Park at sunrise, the day after the next full moon. Come alone. Bring Fritos."
"Hey I agree with you man, but I‚Äôd go further. The American Experiment has proven to us and to the world that any government will always take away rights of its people unless it is beholden to the people and not allowed to reign unchecked."
"Oh yeah! Let‚Äôs invade this private military base which the gov is using to manufacture weapons and start a civil war, great idea üëç"
Fuck yeah
"So do we want communism? Or we just gonna restart and try capitalism again but make efforts to hold CEOs accountable? If we treat CEOs like we‚Äôre treating Area 51 and the FBI right now we‚Äôd be chillin dude

Murica"
"Yo this is serious I likely won't fight if a revolution breaks out I need to work on my academics badly but make sure there is literally no control on what weapons we can or can not own. If we have the money to buy a M1A2, F-16, or Light Cruiser so be it."
I mean sure but there‚Äôs no way there‚Äôs anything of value in area 51
"What if in addition to freeing the aliens in area 51, we also freed the aliens in the concentration camps?"
"See you there! Please do something dumb, it'll be funny to watch."
If you want to spark a revolution have a look at those who would benefit from it.

"Yeah, that's the big hole in my rant. I know it's necessary. I wish it wasn't. I thought that if the US stopped invading countries we wouldn't be at war all the time, but if they stop doing that they're going to be invaded by someone who is fine with it. I guess I wish human nature was different"
"We have 7,000 nuclear warheads, the most advanced military on the planet, and a population of 320,000,000 people armed with 400,000,000 guns, occupying the better part of a continent, 2,900,000 square miles, with every terrain imaginable. 

We could publish everything tomorrow and it would change NOTHING. Nobody is coming over here because nobody is capable."
Or maybe they don't want my crackhead uncle joe to have flashbangs too LMAO
I hope y'all aren't actually serious and are still memeing...
"Or... maybe it‚Äôs because civilians have no need for military grade weapons. I mean really, if you had access to flashbangs, rocket launchers and machine guns with 100+ round clips, what would you possibly use them for? Aside from murder."
"Or just... Get more people to vote for your party and be ruthless in keeping them in power. If you don't want more taxes, there are politicians working for that. It is difficult to change the makeup of state reps (the people who actually make the changes that you feel every day), but it isn't impossible and the chance comes about fairly frequently.

If you find that relying on votes requires you to reconcile with the fact that people just have different opinions about what is predatory or whatever, organize large-scale protests (through... Like... Not memes). Historically, that's managed to spark change without going all militant."
"I can‚Äôt stand their types either. Whenever we intervene on an international issue, ‚ÄúREEEEE why can‚Äôt America stay out of something for once?‚Äù. Meanwhile, if we didn‚Äôt do anything, ‚ÄúREEEE why isn‚Äôt America helping?‚Äù

"I think you're right with the police or readied MP defenders, definitely not right with tours. I can't think of a single time civilians went into Area 51.

"Technically I think I'm right wing, but that really shouldn't matter about things like this"
"I probably wont go, but my beliefs still stand"
This is possibly the hottest and dumbest take ever.
"You got a point, I take it back and say that explosives and things like it (flashbangs, tear gas grenades, etc.) should still be outlawed, but I feel that guns should be open to the public (if murder is the problem, they still conveniently seem to get ahold of these guns anyway)"
i don't the police don't either.
"Perhaps not explosive weapons, but I see no reason why automatic guns and other military-grade weapons (like sniper rifles for example) should be so restricted, especially since mass murderers seem to get ahold of them anyway"
if we don't need them why does the government need them? if we ever get invaded we got nukes so no one will ever do it. so why does our military need experimental aircrafts and lazers?
"The major problem with voting is that people only vote for democratic or Republican parties. If you vote for a different party or an independent candidate, people ridicule you for wasting your vote since they never win"
Lmao. All they gotta do is turn around.
#YOU ARE BREATHTAKING
mmmmmmm....... a podcast i'm pretty sure. I'm not sure which one since I listen to several educational casts that are all fairly similar in tone but they're all reliable and appropriately skeptical shows that do plenty of good research and make clear distinctions between facts and speculation. I just have a ton of random info floating in my head from listening to them all the time.
Wow. So original. So inspired.
I picture them just using a couple huge razor wire bolas to take care of the crowd in a few seconds silently and for very little money.
So what you're saying is that going to Area 51 is gay?
Thanks
Arguably the best animated film yet

"Exactly! This would be best for everyone, but noooo."
Nah bro i see what you mean. Expose this corrupt system.
Nah do something my dude I wanna see some thicc aliens
holy whiskers you go sister
As if *you're* going to do anything...
"It should, but I'm also kinda surprised."
Pls don't tell on me :(
"You made me laugh so fucking hard, thank you"
Plz elaborate... Bankers are not rly the main issue tbh its corporations IMO
I‚Äôm honestly very surprised i got upvoted so much
"Oh then you are wrong there. That comment was a plug for anarchism lol. The failure of the America has proven, at least to me, that any government is doomed to become bloated and evil"
Y‚Äôall know how heavily Americans have been arming themselves for their ‚Äúprotection‚Äù. There‚Äôs a bunch of filthy casuals who are going to show up thinking it‚Äôs occupy Wall Street and meet the Texas rangers with their militia artillery
Smart let's remove all barriers to military equipment. That way when someone is insane and wants to shoot up a school they can just fly a fucking f16 into it.
it really does though. if you want to give more power to corporations we‚Äôre even more fucked than we are now. dismantle capitalism and the state or we‚Äôre screwed.
"Either the government also disarms themselves or nobody does, no one should have the monopoly on violence."
"Or you could look to examples like the UK who don‚Äôt have guns so actually murder rate is quite low down compared to America. 

(However instead of guns Britons are now using knives and acid which isn‚Äôt as good.) but at least a police officer has the upper hand against a man with a knife"
"It's not about the ability to get ahold of guns, it's about the ease to get ahold of guns. You can still get a grenade if you want one, it's just a lot more difficult than getting some HS2000 or Glock variant. Haven't heard much about the grenade epidemic causing a culture of fear in low-income neighborhoods though. 

Lot of people who believe in treating the mental health epidemic are really resistant to doing anything along the lines of helping limit the damage a mentally unhealthy person can do, kinda seems odd. Would be like forcing employees to come to work with the flu, because we can't worry about the spread of the flu we have to look at the *cause.* Seems to me like you can work on the cause and still try to limit the spread of the disease without taking away much from either side."
"Why not be consistent and allow explosive weapons? That dude in Las Vegas killed 50+ people with guns by himself, if we're okay with that in society then why grenades and shit? I can't see the killcount being that much higher."
"Precision rifles are not restricted at all. Maybe in like california but that is it. 

Machine guns serve no purpose besides cool range toys or mass murder. Even the military stays mostly semi auto. Full auto isnt practical besides with fire teams and belt feds"
"Guess we will just send our boys to Afghanistan with just their fists lmao. 

Are you guys for real?"
"Why are you basing your votes on what people think? If your issue is just that they don't win, you could still organize or get with an political organization (a la Greenbacks) to make the chances of a major parties absorbing your ideologies (a la the modern Dem party (maybe)). Alternatively, if you want to exploit the existing system, donate to groups that lobby and/or put money in the pocket of politicians. 

These are fairly practical and time tested. They also don't require nearly as large of the country's population to agree with you as a revolution."

"Massacre or victory, either way they get what they want. If it was going to spark anything, it will do it both ways."

People do that already. The only difference is it will be an even playing field
"Then why not both at once? The corporations that have laws made to their favor will be dismantled if we change the government, while honest businesses should remain mostly intact"
"The military has a practical reason to use greater force and an explicit purpose to engage in warfare. I don't want my neighbor to have an F-15 because he's just going to cause problems.

You guys can have fun cosplaying as revolutionaries, but in the end the world is mostly set up in a way that works and we're not just going to change it because a couple weebs got idealistic."
"Exactly my point. I dont want Billy down the street to have an RPG at all, but if the military can use them, why cant we? Or tear gas, or machine guns, or just about any weapon not designed for hunting at this point"
"Also, just to save you some time

/u/userleansbot

Only political sub I'm in is DirtbagCenter lmao"
"Considering people make homemade explosives if they're dead-set on it, I see no reason why not at this point. For the sake of argument, however, I believe guns at the very least should be accessible to the public"
"Regardless, if the military is allowed to possess them, I see no reason why we can't"
Why are we sending our boys to Afghanistan? To die for Israel or Saudi Arabia?
I'll look into it and report back if I find it.
"I believe it was the podcast Stuff You Should Know and the episode was called How Area 51 works.

"Actually in terms of guns and gear civilians have much better guns because of funding. Milspec rifles are garbage and decent AR15s are way better. 

But for tanks and stuff yes"
"I'm with you comrade, but more than likely they won't even get near the base. Not because of security but because of geography, climate, distance and morale.

If I was the government I would have all the gates leading in closed completely and lock down the main base, have riot military police on standby at the base and let nature do its work.

If they manage to get the 40-70 miles in on foot (or vehicle if they physically take down the fences) they'll have to deal with being blocked inside and surrounded."

Because the military is a controlled system where users of said weapons undergo training and can only use them under supervision or in specific scenarios. It's not like they can bring their weapons home
"Yeah, why cant I own nuclear weapons if gov can."
"For whatever they are doing now. 

They recently took an ISIS stronghold. 

You cant just completely disband the entirety of the armed forces and completely disarm the country because ‚Äúwe have nukes‚Äù. There are times for nukes and times for guns"

Finally a movement I can get behind. Let's do this
"Supervisor material! Delete your comment, well pick you up in an hour. supervisors jump last."
Lol there are actual concentration camps along the border but ok sure let's expose Area 51
"If this were to hypothetically happen (probably very few will show) come survival or slaughter, the issue would probably get more publicity from a slaughter. ""US govt kills 400 weebs"". Anyway, it will probs be like 30 people who gather realise they are only 30 and then have a few beers, or just be turned away quietly."
They can't? My recruiter lied to me!
Pretty sure a lot of veterans bring their rifles home
"Why should the government own nuclear weapons at all? I know it's to deter other countries from using them, but by the same respect, the government having nukes would prevent a normal person from ever using them (plus I'm pretty sure there's only like 10 people in the country who might afford a nuke, and blowing up the country isn't in their best interests)"
"the only guns we need are for self defense. here's an idea, maybe these radical muslims wouldn't want to kill westerners if we got the hell out of their lands and stopped bombing them with drones. violence perpetuates violence."
I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs the one that mentions this story. But it‚Äôs totally possible it was another podcast about Area 51. Anyway have a good night!
"it's, like, totally a double-win scenario, man

like, we win twice"
I think the military should just all leave and only have a gift shop with novelty shirts that say ‚ÄúI ‚Äúraided‚Äù Area 51 and all I got was this shitty T-shirt‚Äù.
"Ya, hard to make memes about kids in cages"
">issue would probably get more publicity from a slaughter

Absolutely. In my opinion, even if one person is killed by the military there will be a big outrage.

If even a handful of people are killed, we're looking at massive protests.

400? Civil unrest and uprising."
"The rifles were never theirs, they're loaned to the soldiers from the military. I believe if you come across a gun, or like capture one from an enemy you might be able to take it home but I imagine it's a long process. 
I wasn't even thinking about rifles though, more the heavy duty weapons."
"The solution isnt to disband the military dude

And also they dont just kill westerners they kill women, gays, eachother, cause terror attacks in europe, etc"

"If you want a real answer, if you watch the one with the sound, it seems like they're doing it to impress/be funny for the girls. They're all squealing in the background and laughing so they're having a good time with the guys who are very confident in their masculinity right up until two of them start frenching."
yeh strange that the girls at the party aren't as into the public stranger kissing game as the dudes huh
The last one on the cookie has to eat it.
Could've been the girls that suggested it
"Not at all.

The goal of the game is to move the card from person to person without it falling. 

If the card falls they touch lips. 

The idea is to have the card falling be a negative and not a positive."
So many ‚Äúaccidental‚Äù smooches as a kiddo. I have fond memories of each boner I got playing that game.

Why the hell would this need sound?

"Why do I feel like everyone on Reddit plays way more gay games than anyone I ever knew. 

I saw a post that had like 20k upvotes saying guys flirt more with their friends than they do with women. Who are these guys? Surely that's pretty closeted, right? We never had to say no homo unironically cause we were not doing questionable things like the ""nervous"" game or this card thing."

"Oh wow I didn't know it went beyond kpop, I just know that it's famous in kpop for that reason.  Guess teenagers are similar wherever you go."
"I can agree with the part that is sort of empowering to see that, the only thing is that it makes the kpop artists very uncomfortable when they're put on the spot to do that.

Not everyone wants to be apart of someone else's fantasy after all, and I think we can agree that male or female that forcing people to do that is bad.

"I've seen a lot of guys do this sort of thing. They are all straight. Gay guys wouldn't do that kind of thing because they don't view that sort of thing as a joke whereas a lot of straight guys just do it because they think its funny any they just don't give a shit.

I'm gay and seeing that shit made me nervous as hell. Every gay guy I've asked has said it was the same for them."
You ever read the story about the wrestler buddies that would hold each other down and ‚Äòrape‚Äô each other as a game? Like not actually rape just mount and make the victim call them daddy before they let them go- but yeah that shit had me in tears.
"I don't know what it was either, but I'm in my mid-thirties now, and we did questionably gay things with each other in high-school and college years. Its obviously all fun and games when it involves your friends, and it might boil down to just being at an hyper-sexual age, and hormonally charged young adults. 

Most of us had girlfriends, but some did go too far at times, making things a bit awkward. And sometimes making us question each other's sexuality with how far someone went. But I guess that's the fun of alcoholism and youth, where we can embarrass each other, especially in front of girls, and challenge the line of being funny or being gay. 

I mean, only in my early 20's would I feel like I can get away with being the outer spoon with 2 other guys, so we can fit on a single bed after a heavy night of drinking; or spotting the moment a friend uses a guard rail at a bar to step and lean on, and seeing an opportunity to slap/tap/pinch his nuts from behind whilst he's chatting up a random; or giving a live demo on how to turn on a chick by tonguing the inner-ear, on another guy friend... in front of other guys."

"It‚Äôs been a party game for a very long time, just usually it‚Äôs not all the same gender. Def not a Kpop thing."
"Yes, I agree. If they are unwilling, it is inappropriate. Just like a guy trying to get 2 girls to kiss, when they don't want to. I would avoid playing that game, too. 

It's just very interesting because I assumed it was the way women thought about sex and what stimulated them that lead women (at least American women) to not find 2 men being sexual a turn-on... I guess that's either wrong or Korean culture is very different in some fundamental way at least in regards to Kpop stars."
"Interesting. Yeah, maybe I was just getting the I don't watch ""gay porn"" answer more than as specific as you are getting. Still fanfiction (if the above guy is right) is usually pretty extreme fantasizing and usually beyond kissing - though maybe you'd find that hot, too. I guess it also seems like they are very open about it, even if they find the same things attractive as women from other cultures. Edit: which is good they feel free to express themselves... but also bad if they are objectifying people."
"If you ever visit Japan, guy on guy manga is super popular. They have bookshelves of the stuff at any manga store you visit. Usually people associate Japan and Korea as being fairly closeted because it's a polite society but they can be much more open about sexuality than the west at times."
"Controversial doesn't mean negative. It's from the upvotes and downvotes. Don't know if you have it set but there is a cross that shows if people are upvoting and downvoting it heavily. It went negative at first and then +9 and then fell down to where it is now. 

I'd wish more people that downvoted me would comment but none seemed to. I just wish for feed back, if you disagree. I have a feeling more than a few just don't like the general notion though for different reasons and don't have organized thoughts about it though.

The ""utoh"" was my attempt at being playful and maybe teasing out some responses."

That's entirely it. Someone made the same joke as /u/DrShrlmpPuertoRico had made. The sub didn't exist at the time so....why not make it real?

Keep up the good work spider dudes
Spiders are the best roommates; they try their best to avoid you and always pay their rent (by catching pests)
Imagine being an Aussie and trying to understand this
^(‚Å± ·µç·µò·µâÀ¢À¢)
"My kitchen spider almost drowned last week in my cats water dish. When I saw him floating in there I was sad, and then went to change the dish.

When I picked the dish up, he lifted one little leg and weakly waved it around. I grabbed a piece of paper towel, stuck it in and he scrambled up onto it, sat there and waited for me to place him back by his web.

We are best buds.

&#x200B;

Edit: Editing to add a picture of my [spider bud](https://imgur.com/yj8v5JU)"
It's just a phobia. I need to get rid of that spider. And i feel really bad because it's not its fault i'm afraid of it :(
"I‚Äôm okay with spiders. But my wound, when I was bitten by one, took weeks to heal."
When there was a spider in the corner of my room i just left it there bcos it could kill the mosquitos there
"Nice try spider satan, not this time.


This post was created by Arachnophobia gang"
Still am scared shitless when I see a spider in my room
"Every once in a while I get some daddy long legs in my bathroom that do some work. But I'm even more amazed by the occasional small black spider. They don't appear to build much in the way of a web, but within a week they'll have a solid pile of tiny gnat corpses. Gnats that I wasn't even aware I had. They're never flying around the house, and we bleach the drains and toilet tank. But all of a sudden, this spider just has hundreds."
r/spiderbro
Yes eat those mosquitoes! Keep it up spiders!
I'm not bothered by small spiders somewhere in the room. But every single spider that has come within a metre of my bed has died. I will not let them kill me in my sleep!
What about the 12 inch tarantula in the attic
Can most spiders actually catch roaches?  I mean they‚Äôre pretty big.
Ive been seeing a lot of pro spider propaganda lately... i‚Äôm onto you spider people
I literally just killed a spider before looking at this
Nice try disguised spider
I once had a large(ish) spider that appeared in the top corner of my room. And I said to my self he‚Äôs done nothing wrong and he stayed there for about a week. Then the day he left I felt really sad. Rest in piece Reggie
This should be on r/spiderbro
Yeah but brown recluses
I am deeply uncomfortable with how the artist both drew the spider with a lot of detail but also super anatomically incorrect.

Well our house spiders bite us in our sleep like dude what do you want us to do
I used to play with those little jumping spiders when I was a kid. Our house is by the country side and those were pretty common in our yard. They were cute and furry. I used to make them jump from one hand to another. Maybe that's why I'm not afraid of spiders.
r/badspideranatomy
"Spiders are cool. There was one spider that made a home for itself outside my bathroom window. That spider helped keep out some of the flys, hornets, and stink bugs from getting in. Sadly, as Winter came, the spider died from the elements. Yet, all the things that spider did will not be forgotten. Thank you, Spider."
Imagine if spiders weren't so fucking creepy how much better of a place the world would be.
"I always let spider bros chill. Unless they're a Black Widow, then fuck that, they dyin. Or if a harmless spider is in my shower when I plan to use it, sorry bro, I'm taking you outside."
"I love jumping spider because they're cute but hate the one that make webs all over my stuffs and room. Huntsman spider is too big and gives me heart attack every i see one. However when i go and get something to deal with it, it disappears and give me paranoia for weeks."
I found a centipede eating a spider the other day. This is NOT good we need something to eat the centipedes now
I love spiders. I used to keep them as pets when I was a kid. Got them houses made of small cardboard boxes and filled the boxes with leaves. They kept running away tho.
"*And kills the spider after, with that blue book*"
r/dontkillspiders
Still burning the house down
Kill it with fire and all the other pests too
Everyone needs validation
This is why I don't kill spiders. I take a tissue and just pick then up gently and set them down on my lawn outside. They're too helpful for me to kill them.
Until the little fuckers leap across the room at mach speed
I always think of them as tiny warriors that live in the corners of my house.
I always pretend I don't see them until my girlfriend makes me evict them.
"TBH I started to think about having a spider pet, to get rid of these damn mosquitoes... but I dunno if it would be safe with my two destruction goddesses that are my dogs"
Yeah until it crawls up your ass
Wish i could feel seen like that spider :/
"Just chilling here in my bed reading this, knowing that my spider bro is protecting my room from danger"
"I posted this before:

I had a small spider in my bathroom that completely wiped out a moth problem we had within a couple months

Never bothered anyone, we never bothered the spider

Pretty cool spider dude"
I'm sorry but if I saw a spider that big I'll burn the house down so there would be no spiders nor pests
"I have always had a mild Arachnophobia, but I have come to peace with it.. kinda.. When I learned the truth about spider bros.

I have one making webs in the ceiling of my bedroom. 

We sometimes have staring competitions, but we good.

But if you ever land on me, or my bed.."
"They‚Äôre cool and all, but once they bite me and leave a huge bump on my skin, that‚Äôs the last straw. Might as well put a stickers on my skin ‚Äúbite me, you gay‚Äù"
"Heh come to Australia

We'll show u the real spiders here"
Bites the kid
"Believe it or not, out of like 30,000 species of spider, only 12 of them are poisonous and have the ability to bite us. I might be wrong though. I probably am. So don't touch any of the spiders you see. Just to be safe."
10/10 would still smash
"Spiders are cool, but they step into my bathroom they‚Äôre fair game."
"Anything under the size of a quarter is cool with me. I don‚Äôt want no brown recluse trying to cozy up to me, them fuckers are scary and will fuck your shit up."
Also: did u know that some of them can FRICKING KILL U WITH ONLY ONE BITE
I just killed a spider four minutes ago now i feel bad
"Leave the spiders alone! Just let them live in your house... It's no biggie, they're cool."
The other day we left one of them giant gross hairy looking centipedes live for that exact same reason. I think I heard it whisper the same thing.
And then they kill it
No mosquitos inside so stay the hell outta my shower

"How do we know if a typical house spider is dangerous? I‚Äôd be cool with keeping these little critters alive, but I gotta know if they‚Äôre safe and if they won‚Äôt hurt my cats"
This may be true but nothing is scarier than seeing a massive spider run across your room just before you go to sleep. That shit freaks out the best of us
"Unless its one of them recluse motherfuckers, they‚Äôre pretty shady if you ask me."
"I love spiders if they live me

Please don't kill me rachnera-san"

poor bois
Never killed a spider intentionally. (Dont live in Australia too)
"If only they didn't have to bite *me* if i get in their way we could live in peace and harmony, but some of those biters are rather potent at rotting patches of one's hide off"
"This is why I don't kill the spiders in my house. Actually tbh I rarely ever see any spiders in my house, and even when I do, they're just those tiny harmless ones and they mostly stay away from me. If I lived somewhere where there were venomous  spiders, then that would be different, they'd have to go."
"I‚Äôve come full circle with spiders. I used to be phobic but eventually got over it. Now I have one that I let stay in the corner of my bathroom, and I leave all the ones in the basement alone. Let ‚Äòem work, let ‚Äòem live."
"If there's no roaches and few mosquitos in my house, then the spider becomes the pest.

Anyone who doesn't hate spiders is an unevolved Cro Magnon."
"I have never even seen a roach or mosquito but we do have plenty of spiders, wish they would kindly leave me alone too. Seriously, recently it‚Äôs like every corner I turn a spider is just stalking me."
"Reminds me of the post a couple months ago, there was a trap full of spiders and everyone complained that they should leave the spiders alive to kill other insects.

How about no insects at all? My house is on lockdown with bug barrier"
"Hi, i love the meme and ik im not mod but can ya try not breaking Rule 9. Again, this is just a reminder"

"I saw a wolf spider in my bathroom the other day while I was pooping. He just kinda froze and sat there til I finished. As I was wrapping up I just looked over and gave him a little nod of understanding. You don‚Äôt disturb my poop, and we have no problems spider bro."
Remember if you see a spider in your house what ever you do DO NOT release it outside. House spiders are specially evolved to live in doors. Putting them outside would be like putting a giraffe in Antarctica.
"As an Australian:

No"
*SPLAT*
I used to spray them with poison but now I simply take them outside.
"My bathroom used to have a bad mosquito problem, so when I saw a spider set up shop on the window I let him stay. After a couple weeks the spider was gone, and so were the mosquitoes. I miss the little guy...."

Cartoon dad looks like George Carlin
"Last week, I was talking with my wife and her friend over some beers in the kitchen. Out of nowhere, a spider walked out on the floor, right in between the three of us, and it exploded into a million little baby spiders. As someone who is severely arachnophobic, I came to two conclusions: 

1) I no longer wish to live in this house.

2) I wish to purchase a flamethrower, in the event that this happens again.

I appreciate the spider‚Äôs place in the ecosystem, but I would strongly prefer that my home remain a spider-free zone."
Why am I suddenly reminded of Jeff the Spider from Billy and Mandy? Lmao
Wait so this guy had a daughter too now?
I still have arachnophobia
"Daddy long legs ‚òëÔ∏è

Any other spider ‚òê *must keep an eye on it's untrustworthy movements towards me*"
I‚Äôm cool with the spiders in my house. As long as they don‚Äôt crawl on my face when I‚Äôm trying to get to sleep. Because I will murder them.
Spiders are so misunderstood... its the roaches that we should be scared of...
This whole sub is spider propaganda! They invade your house and turn you into slushies juices!
"I know this is wholesome and whatnot but I can't help but disagree. I dont have a roach or mosquito problem. I have a spider problem. There's a shit ton in and around my home. Spiders are also food for centipedes. I too have a centipede problem. Therefore, spiders need to get smashed with that big blue book."
"This reminds me of the time when I was growing some lemon trees from seed. I had about six. There was a spider about the size of dime that made a web over them to catch little gnats that would try and eat the leaves. So I left the little dude there and every time (every day) I had to water the seedlings we would have this little system where I‚Äôd put a fork out to him and pick him up, move him temporarily to an empty solo cup, and then once I was done I‚Äôd put him back on his web. He protected my plants and I let him stay there for the yummy buggos. I was always super careful not to mess up his web."
"I recently vacuumed up a beautifully proportional, medium sized, perfectly black spider and now I feel sad about it"
"Listen: If spiders acted all embarrassed and let me pick them up when they are the size of my hand, a ground-spider with necrotic poison, and next to my shoes at 3 am? I wouldn't have to kill any of them. 

But no, they want to go run and hide under my couch while I have no socks on. So in spite of myself, I have to bring the thunder."
"i have a spider in my room i call luci. its the meanest spider ive seen in my room so i decided it could stay. all the other spiders go when i clean my room, but not luci, she is good spider."
"Yeah, if it weren't for spiders, my house would be riddled with roaches and mosquitoes..."
"I‚Äôm terrified of bugs and hate them in general. Was walking through my house and noticed a big spider web in the corner, was ready to destroy it and the spider and then I noticed like 10 mosquito carcasses and other demons stuck in the web. Decided spider was a bro and he can stay."
I'd still kill it
"cool, they can still fuck right off"
And then I kill the spider.
"I‚Äôve had a single spider in my room for a while now, best thing ever. No pests of any kind now! Shout out to my boy Pepe le pew (because he has one leg white like a skunk strip)"
"It‚Äôs truly a shame that they look so scary-scary. Why can‚Äôt they look like little baby turtles or tiny piglets?

Can someone work on this technology to make spiders look friendlier? You‚Äôre sitting on a gold mine!"
"So do centipedes, but they never get any love #freethecentipedes"

We shouldn't kill spiders. They are our best guardians against bugs. I admire them a lot

I have insane arachnophobia but I just cant kill these guys because I know they're just chilling trying to do their job
dont hate me for eating you in my sleep tho.

I let the spider bros chill in the top corners of the porch. Keeps out the bugs
[Reminded me of this classic](https://youtu.be/ms2klX-puUU)
That's kinda what my mom did when she saw us reacting to spiders just like her. She didn't want us to be terrified of spiders like she was all her life. So she pretended not to be irrationally afraid of spiders and taught us kids about their niche in the wild.
"This is exactly why I let them stay in the house. I was somehow able to convince the landlady that they are a positive contribution, as we do tend to get a shit ton of the pests flying through*. Thanks, Florida.

Spiders get too much hate for literally no reason.
"I live where there aren't many dangerous spiders (and I know what they look like) so I let the wolfies, jumpers, and the creepy pretty orb weaver (cobweb spiders) live with me! 

When I first moved in, I took all the spiders outside with a glass and paper. Then I had too many bugs. Basement apartment. Now I have recultivated a healthy soider community!"
"Since I live where the spiders are harmless I don‚Äôt mind them. Worst thing my state has is the brown recluse, but in my lifetime I haven‚Äôt even witnessed one."

It's funnier if you read the dialogue in an Australian accent.

Man I just go finished cleaning my shed and killed hundreds of them. Now I feel awful.
Thats fine & all but they don‚Äôt need to be close TO MY FACE! Freaks me out TBH
Well I kill them all roaches and spiders
Or live in a house with zero insects and arachnids?
I would still kill it. BURN THEM ALL!!!
Not a fan of spiders regardless.
"That's great and all but we have no roaches, and no mosquitos inside so spiders can fuck right off."
"That's wholesome AS SHIT, nice work little spider-guy"
If there's a spider big enough to take down a roach... they can get right the fuck out of my home.

"Spiders are fine elsewhere but
Please don‚Äôt come in my room
It‚Äôs off limits like Area 51,

I'm still killing it tbh
Really wish I could actually befriend spiders. Would make me a whole lot less scared of them.
"Ruined opportunity for the spider to say ""they -get- me"" üï∏Ô∏è"
I‚Äôm sorry little one but I will still crush you into atoms I‚Äôm ducking scared ok(I have a phobia on spiders)
Rather have the other insects
I always love having spiders in my house for this reason. So long as they dont hurt me I love them. My husband on the other hand is terrified of all spiders so if I find one I usually have to sneak it outside so he doesn't kill it.
I have orb weavers outside my house and they always build their webs in the pathway leading out of my house so I've made it a habit every morning to take the anchor webbing and move it to the sides of the pathway. Gotta say I definitely feel they make my porch a little more bearable with less mosquitoes.
Tell that to the spider that keeps biting my fucking leg in the middle of the night. I have like 3 huge wounds and bruising because of that dick.
See this would be fine  . . . If you didn't live in Australia üòë
When I moved I haved spiders walking over mi leg each night I hope they burn in hell
"i killed a spider yesterday


oops"
All i aka is that they stay out of my room. If i find one in my room... it‚Äôs game over
But i just terminated half the population in my house today.
Got me in the first half not gonna lie
After reading Charlotte‚Äôs Web I could never kill spiders!! Odd I still eat pork tho...
r/spiderbro
I have a lizard in my room and I love him (I'm not assuming genders) for this reason.
Sure unless the levels of bugs and mosquitos are next to nothing. Then they wait til you're asleep then crawl all over your body and find a nice spot to snack on. Usually the damn face!
"They get rid of pests by melting their insides and drinking them while they‚Äôre stuck in the spiders web, helpless, afraid."
"Same, but the second the spider for some reason decides to crawl on me that's just an unforgivable  violation of personal space"
"This helps a lot. On the other hand, my husband got bitten when throwing a particularly monstrous one outside once, so now I‚Äôm only cool with the smaller ones. Obviously he‚Äôs fine but he was a bit surprised at the time!"
The only spiders I allow in my house are the cellar spiders. Some would know them as daddy long legs. Weird name but they can't hurt you so I just leave them unless they go in my bedroom or shower.
Yeah this meme wouldn‚Äôt go down so well here in Australia
"In ancient times, a King had a boulder placed on a roadway. Then he hid himself and watched to see if anyone would remove the huge rock. Some of the King‚Äôs wealthiest merchants and courtiers came by and simply walked around it. Many loudly blamed the king for not keeping the roads clear, but none did anything about getting the stone out of the way. Then a peasant came along carrying a load of vegetables. Upon approaching the boulder, the peasant laid down his burden and tried to move the stone to the side of the road. After much pushing and straining, he finally succeeded. After the peasant picked up his load of vegetables, he noticed a purse lying in the road where the boulder had been. The purse contained many gold coins and a note from the king indicating that the gold was for the person who removed the boulder from the roadway. The peasant learned what many of us never understand. Every obstacle presents an opportunity to improve our condition."
So glad I'm not the only one. Spiders are great. I always appreciate their work around the summertime when the inevitable fruit flies end up around my trash can. My cat's getting elderly and can't catch such tiny things anymore; the spiders do the job nicely.
Just wait until you live in Australia. The paranoia will set in when it‚Äôs time to put on your shoes
"We have two major ones currently - one bathroom, one bedroom - that I have named Ricardo and Archibald, respectively."
"I have three in my basement, they're all named Steve. Have been in the same exact spot each time I go into that room. I thank them for eating bugs and ask them to not leave their room."
Denmark?
Im cool until one gets in the shower with me and then its every arachnid for its self
"I let them live in the garage, and look fine on Halloween."
"I'm cool with the really tiny ones and the ones that have long skinny legs and tiny bodies. Anything aside from that dies, then again I live in a location with brown recluse and black widows, if I saw a large recluse though I'd probably just kill myself out of fear."
There are deadly spiders where I live but they are very rare and don't look like the rest of the spiders
*Laughs nervously in Australian*
I‚Äôm cool with spider too. But where I live spider ain‚Äôt cool with people :(

"Last night I stopped my gf in rare form about to destroy this big, puffy  guy. When I intercepted to transport it outside, I noticed it's puffy back was squirming/pulsing in many tiny, odd movements. I believe it was preggers, but cannot be certain. Thank god she didn't smash it as she wasn't prepared for that onslaught or the necessary genocide that would have followed"
Hate to see the size of the spider that keeps roaches in check.
I named the spider in my old apartment Bob :)
"I had a ""segestria florentina"" (pretty big italian spider) making a lair next to my outside door near the ceiling. It was a mutual respect relationship, i didn't want to kill it and it moved inside its lair as soon as i was approaching the door. 100% cool neighbor, I'm sad it disappeared a year ago after 3 years of living in the lair, he/she (probably she) was called ""Amilcare"" and god only knows why i wasn't afraid of that spider, i am mortally terrified of them usually"
Me too. My only rule is don't try to get in my mouth while I'm asleep. But I generally ask that of anyone staying over.
Tell that to the spider I found on my headboard right next to me and almost broke my ankle trying to run away. What a creepy fella.
"We're probably the worst roommates lol. Spider's like, ""These mfkrs always leaving a mess, attracting roaches and flies. I get rid of them and *I'm* the disgusting one?"""
"> they try their best to avoid you

The ones in my house must not have gotten the memo."
Then why have I woken up to a spider crawling onto my pillow atleast 3 times.
I have 30 lil baby spiders right above my bed and their mamma. Couldn't bring myself to kill them so just gonna let them roam and pray most they leave my room.
"Australia had to ban an episode of Peppa Pig because the whole morale of the story was ""spiders can't hurt you and it's ok to pick them up and play with them"", which is maybe a good thing to teach kids in the UK, but certainly not in the land down under.

"We like most spiders, especially the huge [Huntsmans](https://media.australianmuseum.net.au/media/dd/images/Some_image.width-1200.cfebc9d.jpg)."
"""Oi lads my domestic huntsman spider just destroyed the leash with his fangs and killed two cows on the way to hunt crocodiles"" lmao"
"I know this is a joke, but for real, you will seldom actually see spiders (or any animals) that are harmful to humans here - provided you aren't out in the middle of whoop-whoop (or the ocean) lol... Personally, I've seen 2 redbacks in my life, and one of those was dead.

On the note of Huntsmans, though: they're really good at controlling creepie-crawlies, but are absolutely fucking terrifying if you don't like spiders. They move so quickly, and just have SO MUCH leg. Seeing one IRL (especially at night, or in your bedroom) is traumatic omg.

^(like maybe??)
I wanna be your best bud too!
I have a couple of spiders living in my bathroom. I accidently sprayed one with Tilex and quickly sprayed him with a bunch of water. I was so upset. I thought I'd killed him. He seems to have made a full recovery. Yay.
"""So there I was, no longer able to stay afloat I waved good-bye to my wife and started to go under. Suddenly, an immense being lowered its hand and reached out to me. I began to float into the sky, and when I finally came to, I was outside my house - dripping wet. Swear to God bro."""
Take a poor lady‚Äôs silver. What a great story!
I have a bathroom spider!! Well... Had. I went away for the weekend and she disappeared. But I welcome spiders.
You're a generous god to it.
But I am so god damn afraid of it.
"I can bring some species outside, but giant brown house spiders make my brain shutdown at every movement of their little crawly evil hairy freaking legs and i need to seek help and guidance from the higher beings (or the vacuum cleaner, but i am really reluctant to use it)"
I was scared. But I visit /r/spiderbro to be more comfortable with them and hey! I've learn what species are venomous and what aren't and how to distinguish them. Pretty neat
Ignorance plays a part. I have no idea if that spiders a harmless bug eater or if its bite would necrotize a hole in my leg.
"Same, bees are fine and i'm not scared of most bugs but seeing a real life spider sometimes almost paralyzes me. If it's at night and he's somewhere in a corner i have troubles sleeping because 

1) my imagination plays tricks on me, having it look like it's moving closer

2) every little itch or hair that touches something makes me think it's a spider crawling over my skin

Arachnophobia fucking sucks"
I‚Äôm normally so calm and level headed that my coworkers at my new(ish) job already know that when I freak out it means spider. Like I can stay calm if I have to deal with an angry dog and I can pick up a hissing cat but I‚Äôm not cool with spiders. My brain just shuts down and total instinct takes over

I love spiders but I hate it when they do that. Like damn I was just minding my own business.
Sounds like a recluse bite
Im always scared it‚Äôll end up in my bed
All spiders are the devil's workers and must be eradicated with extreme prejudice
You have mosquitoes in your house?
Forget killing I can't let them lay their eggs or shit on my skin or bed. Or letting them have a chance to get into my ear or mouth. I don't know much about individual spider species and what makes some of them more dangerous than others so my rule of thumb is to just kill them all on sight or to run away and plead someone else to kill them for me.
I only trust spiders that keep to their corners. All these pioneer spiders will face the wrath
"Easy, you burn your attic"
I was thinking about this too. Maybe they eat the eggs. Can someone please confirm or refute
Time for you to head to the church.
"Spiders are cool as long as they stay in the walls or garage. They enter my bedroom at their own risk, though."

You beat me to it. This animation/song needs to be shared under every spider post.
"I suppose if one lived in a far corner of my room that‚Äôd be ok.  But if it‚Äôs traveling or trying to take up residence in a corner close to my bed, I just can‚Äôt trust that it‚Äôs going to respect my personal space, and it has got to go."

Nice words from u/CarFucker400
"Yeah that's the point where he has to go but not die.
Just take him with a napkin outside"
"Nope, sorry. You crawl on me and my arachnophobia kicks in and you get swiped. I can appreciate the work they do, but fuck that, spiders have super senses and they know better than to crawl on giant mountains of death."
"Yea the spiders in my house are pretty chill and stay out of the way. But the two encounters I've had with large black wolf spiders just happened to be completely violating lol, like they're the oblivious, terrifying klutzes of the spider kingdom. 

Little dude sheepishly approaching the bathtub while I shower for some micro sips of water? No problem, I'll even place a droplet right in front of that homie to make sure he stays hydrated. But when you're a huge dark furry boy and decide to fall into the kitchen sink while I'm doing dishes, CLEARING MY HEAD BY LESS THAN TWO INCHES, or CRAWLING OUT FROM BEHIND MY PILLOW WHILE I'M READING IN BED... shit son who ever gave you the right to perform these nightmare antics"
"You will enjoy this story.

I thought I felt something on my arm when I was in bed, but couldn't find anything. Figured it was just the sheet.

Half an hour later, definitely felt something move, and pulled a squishy spider out from under my pj shirt.

Freaked out, I think I managed to flick it away, but I lost sight of it.

I live in Australia too, so there is always a risk."
"Any creature that gets on my face is going to be hunted down and killed. I can be understanding, but once you land on my face, the gloves come off."

"I think cellar spiders actually eat some of the thicker, hairier spiders, so while I'm generally arachnophobic, I can tolerate them. The thicker ones are much more bothersome to me."

I think too many summers spent in the countryside where every gross insect seems to jump, crawl, bite and ooze at you, for no reason, at all times. Plus that one time my grandmother ate a cockroach that crawled into her cereal bowl."

I'm not going to sleep without checking the walls and ceiling for bugs ever again, that whole experience was frightful."

"You shouldn‚Äôt pick up spiders in any country, except if it‚Äôs your docile pet tarantula which has gotten used to it, but even in this case not too much either. Handling them stresses them out majorly and if you let them fall onto the hard floor they can hurt themselves fatally.

"Totally. Like those technically not spiders daddy long legs or whatever they're called don't scare me much. But fat spiders arr scary. I remember i was gonna go to sleep and saw one on the gouund running so fast, i literally jumped on bed like a little girl (i'm male btw). There was so much adrenaline running in me i knew i won't fall asleep immediatelly. After some time i decided to bring my cat in. She was literally eating it for like 30 minutes. And in this country we don't even have huge spiders, so ypu might not even be scared of that one."
But when I go in that sub I still get scared because it‚Äôs these massive spiders

"But why tho? Human not so tasty and kill meh, stupid fly schmeckt so gut üòã"
"No, but they seem to find me where ever i go."
The more you kill them the more spider pheromones you get in your system. This  leads to more spiders crawling in your mouth and into your arse when you sleep.
And kill the Mormons?
"Yep. I've always been a spiderbro, but after seeing that video many years ago I was able to turn my wife into a spidergal."
No it is not. If you see a spider in your house it is likely one of several species of house spider. They hunt on common insects found in your house. If you remove them from the house unless they find a way back in they will starve or fall prey to other predators.
People who get me??! Bro everyone thinks I am weird for not murdering spiders and stuff I have never met anyone who thought like I do XD.
"
Unfortunately, many house spiders have only ever lived in your home and don‚Äôt have any idea how to live outside. I think I read that only 5% of all spiders you‚Äôll find inside have even ever been outside, let alone know how to survive out there. They die pretty darn fast after being kicked out. I‚Äôve still put *many* spiders outside for not keeping their hands to themselves, but I always feel so guilty about it."
If you take a house spider outside it will in fact die. (unfortunately)
Some deserve a good ol squash
"I had a cute little fuzzy spider on my forearm recently and politely took him out to my porch. He bamf'd off my arm and all was well. 

I used to be deathly afraid of them but something in me changed. They are okay. I also like the joke that says any change you find in your couch is rent money from them."
Yes! Do that!
I‚Äôm a fan of using a cup and something flat to cover the cup opening! Makes it easier for me not to smush their legs.

Still i wasn't afraid of spiders when i was a kid, but i grew up while my mother was absolutely terrorized by even the small ""cute"" jumping spiders so i think that is one of the reasons i got my arachnophobia. I don't blame my mother tho, she almost lost a leg to a spider bite, she was bitten from a relative of the black widow https://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latrodectus_tredecimguttatus"

"As a kid, the night before a trip to Disneyland a spider crawled across my chest while in bed. I whipped my covers off and jumped out of bed. I never saw that spider again. I went and laid on the couch and got no sleep so I was dead tired at Disneyland and didn't have a great time. I couldn't sleep in that room for a week afterwards because I was convinced that spider was just waiting in my bed somewhere."
"My heat nearly skipping a beat at the sight of that little bugger, I mean giant monster"

"They are massive at times! But they can be pretty tiny and just harmless too. Like the jumping spiders.

That actually looks exactly like my old student accommodation
"If I remember correctly, they make the jails like that to make a small community inside the jail that is like the daily world where the prisoners are thought to behave like normal people. They can work, socialize, and even pay for there own thinks with money they get from working. It's all to help them get into the normal swing of things rather than steal"
This looks like an IKEA catalogue.
"I think this community is split on its views. I see posts like this, then a week later posts about horrible criminals who deserve death

Edit: spelling"
"Lack of freedom, to me, already seems like a harsh enough punishment. 

Even though countless studies show more progressive forms of rehabilitation to be more effective at preventing recidivism, in the US, we just don‚Äôt care. We‚Äôd rather see a bad person suffer than see them not be a bad person anymore. Its in our blood and established by puritans. 

It‚Äôs fucking weird and kinda sick tbh."
Because in America corporations have found a way to make money from the prison system. More prisoners=more profits.
"My brother has been in and out of centers since he was 14 in the States. His last stint at 28 put him away for 10-15 years. He's been a habitual offender and did not get off lightly this time. 

The problem is that he has no hope for life when getting out. He has no support structure and has alienated family with his actions. Employers won't touch him because most of his adult life has been spent in prison. Why take the risk with such large employment gaps in his history? He's a liability with no marketable skills or trade. I've seen fast food places bin an app for simply admitting they'd been jailed previously.

He'll be around 40 before he gets this time. He'll completely have missed his kids growing up. Family can't risk being around him. He's gonna get out, find he has no options, and take whatever actions he can to get by. Likely ending up as not one of the kind homeless folks just having a rough time but the deeply troubled, dangerous, and unpredictable sort that might just as well mug you if you refuse to give them what they want. 

Far from being #1, the States are not a pretty place to be if you don't have the means to pay for basic things like shelter, water, food, electricity, garbage disposable, communications, or healthcare."
"It‚Äôs a difference between how people view prison and its purpose. Should it be a punishment where it‚Äôs made very unejoyable to hurt them for their actions as some sort of revenge and attempt to deter them in the future, Or is it to help then change and stop committing crime for when they get out and help them become a normal member of society again. I‚Äôd say the second one is more important but many would disagree."
[removed]
Those prison cells were designed by IKEA
"Unpopular opinion: ASAP deserves punishment for assulting that guy. If someone stalks you or hits your bodyguard, detain the dude and call the police. Also, if a Swedish person did that in the US he would also most definitely be jailed. Under much worse conditions."
"But the US system is about punishment, not rehabilitation. Add for profit prisons, and it works exactly as intended, and endless revolving door of profits (criminals)."
"We have the same concept i Norway. The prison is like its own little community where you have to get up, go to school/work, go ‚Äòhome‚Äô buy groceries, interact with others and so on. (At least for the less dangeorus offensers)
This is a great way of making sure they become a functional member of the society when they get released.
I wrote an essay about this in school and the re-offending rate is much lower than the US for instance.

On the other side its much more expensive way of doing prison, but Norway have the recourses and the empathy enough to take care of its citizens. We also have a small population so we must take care of them as well to sustain ourselves."
"I hate this because when people say it's cushy... I work in a mining city. Theres camps everywhere.

People hate camps with a passion, that have rooms like this. Sure some people don't mind them... But they also go to a rewarding job, talk to people, get to leave their room whenever, have access to good food, and exercise facilities and could come in town whenever they want and get alcohol and shit.


Even then they still say it's fucking torture and like prison. 

But no, somehow people can't get over someone having a TV, or we painted the walls and didn't leave em grey, or gave them a fucking shelf like what the fuck are we thinking amirite?"
"Isn‚Äôt jail meant to be a combination of rehabilitation, punishment and protection of society? I don‚Äôt think people should be made to take shits in the corner of the room or anything but I don‚Äôt think decorating it like a uni accommodation is the right idea either. There  are a lot of people that need prison to feel like a deterrent, not a comfy place to be. I remember in college we met with a repeat offender in prison and he basically said ‚Äòwhy would I want to leave prison? Everything there is provided for me and free, when I‚Äôm out I‚Äôm seen as a prisoner and nothing more, my life is better inside because I can get anything I want‚Äô. For some people who we want to rehabilitate and have return to society it‚Äôs important to make them feel like humans. But for people who have life sentences/show no remorse for their crimes and have no interest in rehabilitation, surely prison has to be considered a punishment. It doesn‚Äôt have to be one extreme or the other but those pictures look better than some studio apartments, I can see why some people wouldn‚Äôt want to leave."
TIL jails in Sweden are nicer than my apartment.
"We need programs.  My guys that were in there over 10 years should have GEDS, basic computer knowledge, substance treatment, therapy, and job skills.  It is inexcusable that we do 
not have these in every prison.

"This concept in the Netherlands really astounds me! It‚Äôs one of those common sense-genius moves. Of course if you treat people with respect and dignity and create an environment for people to better themselves while in prison the likelihood they will and leave with better opportunities and changed perspectives increases tenfold. Unfortunately in the US we decided to privatize our prisons so they‚Äôre just looking to get as many people in as possible. The higher recidivism, the higher profits are. We need to shut that down and start from scratch if we want real justice reform."
"But if they don't commit another offense, they won't make it back to jail to make prisons more money duh???  


Slave/owner mentality still alive and well"
" If someone hurts my family or me I really don't want them to go to a nice place, I want them to differ some too. But that's the lizard brain talking, I know we should do what's best for society and that's scrapping the retribution part of justice and focussing entirely on rehabilitation."
"If we're talking about where we hold a 20 year-old that stole from a supermarket this system works.

However it seems most people here on Reddit are sheltered. There are people who rape and murder their own children. Some ignore any acknowledgement of who they are, others will simply own what they did and smile like they are proud of it. Some of these psychos will retaliate with deadly violence to any form of phyiscal contact. 

You let your guard down and treat some of these people good, and they'll take advantage of you. Sometimes innocence and hospitality doesn't mean a thing to some criminals; like those that already hurt innocent people."
"Swede here, that is actually a prison in Sweden, ASAP is in jail, which is nowhere close to as nice as the prison in the pictures. There are plenty of cases both in Sweden, the EU and the UN where Swedish jails are criticized for being harsh and inhuman."
This shit look better than my college dorms
And in Denmark you can be allowed to leave the prison for a day or a weekend to see family and friends
"I don't know if jail's are supposed to, but they should.  I think they were originally made for prisoners of war or to be used as a deterrent.  Sweden prisons like this are relatively new but totally work and should be used whenever possible"
I once read an article on prisons. The punishment of prisoners is deprivation of freedom not being treated like shit.
I don't think white America wants to rehabilitate their record breaking prison population.
American prisons are the new legal form of slavery.  It is not about rehabilitation here.
This had been my argument in yhe army for years. People act how they are treated. You treat peole like children they act like it.
"I mean no matter how nice the cell is - you still can‚Äôt do, eat, go or contact who you want. Don‚Äôt understand the US/UK need to make prison absolutely awful. Also helps breed the stereotypical prison culture.

Knew someone who went to prison for 3 months after the London riots - his girlfriend was my friend. She told me about his time inside and I just thought it sounded brutal for a 17 year old kid to be in those conditions with a lot of awful people. 

(After the riots they really threw the book at everyone. I think he handled stolen goods - didn‚Äôt actually steal anything)"
Where‚Äôs the stats on reoffenders after leaving that style of jail? Did it help?
"I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
Yet I cannot help but notice that even though this post has so many upvotes, most of redditors would rather have a lot of criminals killed on sight than try and put them back on the right path. Every time there is someone remotely known accused of something serious, another witchhunt starts. Either people on here are very hypocritical or only the tamest of criminals deserve to be treated like this."
"For the people who think this is too good for criminals, it's still punishment. 

You are being lived. You are told when to eat, when to shit, when to sleep. There's not a single door you have a key of. 

It's difficult to understand the psychological effects of incarceration until you have lived it. 

You could be locked up in the Ritz. If you can't get out, if you can't make even the most basic decisions about how your day will be, then you will experience it as a punishment."
"America has this ‚Äúcriminals don‚Äôt deserve education, programs, degrees, etc‚Äù outlook that comes out of the Reagan era ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù attitude, even though those programs are cheaper in the run and proven to reduce recidivism. So what ends up happening is people end up going to jail for 10+ years for nonviolent drug offenses at the age of 20 and come out at the age of 30+ with no skills AND they‚Äôre convicted felons.
Scandinavian countries, on the other hand, go off the assumption that, should you be convicted of a felony, you should be a felon for the length of your sentence, at which point you should have received substantial rehabilitation, insofar that you shouldn‚Äôt be a felon or a convict upon your release. 
And it‚Äôs really a simple premise: if the crime you committed was so heinous and awful that you should still be a felon after your release from prison, you shouldn‚Äôt be released from prison to begin with, because you haven‚Äôt been rehabilitated enough to ensure that you won‚Äôt commit another heinous crime."
"the vast majority of incarcerated individuals will be released at some point. it is in *everyone‚Äôs* best interest to make sure they are ready to re-enter society. criminals should *absolutely* face punishment for their crimes, but by failing to prepare them to re-enter their communities‚Äìand often making it as difficult as possible for them to become contributing members of society‚Äìwe are hurting *everybody.*"
Kind of reminds me of a mental health facility
Rest of the developed world: duh.
"Also while smericand think it's ""too cozy"", its still prison. From documentaries I've watched it starts to wear on you not being able to leave an area no matter what no matter how nice it is."

because he‚Äôs famous? well too bad for him then 

btw that jail looks better than the flat i live in ffs"
"I don't think the low recidivism rate is entirely thanks to prison conditions. It's a combination of factors, most important of which is the expansive safety net for low income households & the unemployed. But then there's also a definite culture against criminal behaviour, the availability of opportunities for social mobility and low geographic concentration of crime. It has taken many decades to develop all this.

Poor(er) countries or ones without the expansive safety nets often see, in addition to higher crime rates, a criminal culture emerge. Fewer opportunities for social mobility & insulation of 'criminal neighbourhoods' usually go hand in hand with development of gangs and the glorification of crime. In these places, just changing prison conditions to be more lenient will certainly not have the desired effect."

Then the criminal is placed in a nice cell, 3 meals a day and made comfortable in the hope that he will change..

"Probably because prisons are not private there

It's just that if you almost kill someone (kicking someone while they're down and you're outnumbering them 8v1) and try and play that off as self defense then you're in for a treat. We got laws in Sweden and if you break them you face the consequences. There isn't more to it than that. Some random drunk kid spotting an american celebrity and then going on to follow them because he probably thinks they're cool. He then threw his headphones on his bodyguard but dude he's some skinny drunk kid and you're 8v1 and you got the incredible hulk (bodyguard) on your side, there wasn't ever any real threat.

&#x200B;

Lots of crimes here are forgiven if there is a clear case of self defense but actual assault on someone who's already down as well as excessive use of violence isn't the same thing. Our judicial system works and doesn't care if you're rich or not. This is his reality check and hopefully he'll learn something from it.

&#x200B;

You could of just wrestled him down and called the cops but instead you beat him up, smash a bottle on him so he starts bleeding and then kick him while he's down? That's some real issues you got if you wanna call that a matter of self defense.

&#x200B;

One second we get called ""TOO SOFT ON CRIMINALS"" by Americans and then we get called ""TOO HARSH"". Please stop it with the propaganda and get out of your bubble of ignorance. I'd probably try and solve your own problems before you try and solve ours.

We've done pretty good on our own so far thank you very much. I love the U.S and got relatives there like so many others but when it comes to the judicial system I'd rely on our own way before yours. We're not your enemies and Sweden and the US have great relations but since we respect your laws you need to respect ours, we're not even on the same page when it comes to class related issues or the normalization of excessive violence.

&#x200B;

""If the US were your home instead of Sweden you'd experience 95.65% more of a class divide""

Now that's actually really scary and should get you thinking about the difference between rich and poor. Very important factor when you want fair trials and laws.

"Used to work with halfway house/transfer center guys. The main downfall of the guys who went back is they couldn't switch out of the prison mentality.

Someone even tried stabbing the janitor one day. Drugs everywhere they'd get from people whod show up just to sell. It's bad.

"The function of jail (prison if we're being accurate) is a centuries-old debate which spans the spectrum from all rehabilitation to all punishment.

My own city has a jail so bad folks are resigning over it. On top of all of this, we have taxpayers who will never want to dedicate money to improving conditions, private companies that somehow run many jails, and truthfully gangs who wouldn't want too much freedom as it weakens their hold on the helpless.

Thank you, Sweden, for wanting to rehabilitate (I'm not sure though if ALL prisons are like this or just a few) but shit ain't happening here, where the book is not thrown at someone but instead beaten down on their head like a cartoon character."

"Same. From the UK and that's 100% what my uni room looked like - shower is in the same place everything. There's no way this is a coincidence, it's a carbon copy. I guess they just have one architect reusing his only design.

EDIT - To answer all the questions from my bewildered American brethren:

1. Yes this is a common setup for university dorms in the UK. En-suite is always an option. It can be the norm in most decent universities. 

2. No. Students are almost never expected to share rooms. Even the worst universities I've seen don't have shared rooms. I'm sure they do exist somewhere though. You can usually could opt to pay about 15% more for a larger room with a double bed. 

3. Most modern dorms have built in showers yes, but for the ones that don't you would be expected to share with 4 others max. I've visited 6 universities and never saw more than 5 to a shower. 

4. University costed me about ¬£14k/$18k including tuition and rent. I'm old as fuck though so this was over 10 years ago. The cost of tuition to study anything is now $11k a year I believe. So $33k for a degree. Throw on another $5k for rent. 

5. Yes. Everyone had their own rooms so it was a complete fucking sexfest. The guy in the dorm next to me completely lost count of his bodycount after our second semester. He was a virgin when we started."

Some guy will litter and comments will sentence him to death. Reddit‚Äôs gotta be mad about something
">I think this community is split on its views. I see posts like this, then a week later posts about horrible criminals who deserve death
>
>Edit: spelling

Most communities are. That's because  unlike what OP claims, jail is about many things, not just rehabilitation. It's also about incapacitation, deterrence, and *retribution*. 

So yeah, suffering absolutely is part of why we punish criminals. We as a society need to know that those who commit significant evil receive some kind of retribution. It is an entirely normal and fundamental aspect of how societies function. 

Now we can argue that depriving someone of their freedom should be sufficient retribution and that they should be housed in humane conditions. I entirely agree with that. 

But the statement that ""jail should be about rehabilitation"" is completely nonsensical. Rehabilitation is only a part of why we lock people up. And that's OK."
Heres something we should all agree on-for profit prisons and the cronies who make bank off them can fuck right off.
It seems like Reddit has been wishing death or severe punsihment on stupid people who don't deserve it. People here were saying that the girl who picked ice cream is a biological terrorist who deserves life in prison.

"It's criticism of a system versus reaction to an individual.

Kinda hard to see some dude beat his baby to death and say he deserves to be rehabilitated with a TV and private shower in his own personal room. I mean, he *should* deserve that, all criminals should. But not a lot of people are gonna put in the effort to argue for it when specifically talking about him."
"I've found that on a general level, Reddit wants Prisons to be like the ones pictured. But when it comes to individual cases, Reddit advocates for overtly harsh sentences."
"Take a look at how the abortion issue works in this country.  If you hate abortion, there are a bunch of good ways to make sure we don‚Äôt have as many.  Comprehensive sex ed and free contraceptives and birth control would make a big dent, but those ideas are completely unacceptable to the people who also want there to be less abortions.  What do they propose?  Punish anyone who gets pregnant and doesn‚Äôt want to be.

This shows up in most of our other problems.  A guy committed a low level crime because he needed some money and his community has been so broke for multiple generations that the idea of getting a good job is popularly regarded as a joke?  Why did you keep paying attention after the word ‚Äúcrime,‚Äù punish him!

Somebody‚Äôs working the maximum hours their employer will give them and still doesn‚Äôt make enough to buy food and keep the lights on, especially since the employer knows how much to pay a person before the food stamps get cut off?  Let‚Äôs reduce those benefits anyway, fuck you for not getting a better job!  Punishment!"
"It's not weird. It's the difference between Prisons being a for profit business, and Prisons being a solution to a societal problem"
"Something that always kinda... concerns me is the idea of a death penalty, especially in the way it‚Äôs implemented and defended in the US. 

Conceptually, I can‚Äôt see the difference between the boogyman of ‚Äúsocialist hospital death panels deciding who lives and dies‚Äù, and ‚Äújury of people who don‚Äôt give a shit sentencing someone to death because he‚Äôs black‚Äù. Nor can I follow the logical threads of ‚Äúbig government regulating everything and controlling our lives bad‚Äù but ‚Äúgovernment having the power to determine who is legally allowed to live or die good‚Äù. Because that‚Äôs what the death penalty is. It‚Äôs the government exerting control on who‚Äôs *permitted to live.* Holy shit, people. What happened to ‚Äúlife‚Äù being an inalienable right?"
I agree but the group of people that try to go to jail because it‚Äôs a place to sleep and eat would exponentially increase if our jails were this nice. That could be fixed by offering people affordable wages or helping people of the streets I know but the system has been fucked from the top down for awhile now unfortunately
"It is the same conversation with Welfare, unemployment benefits and so many, Americans would rather focus on punishing bad guys than protecting good guys."
"It's a for-profit system, so it requires recidivism to stay in business.."
"Nobody wants to be ""soft on crime"" and it's bullshit"
"Prisons should all be run directly by the government. It should not be a profit and loss company, too many vested interests. If its making profits, what services are curtailed, what cheaper alternatives are being used ? 

There needs to be some sort of rehabiliation, there needs to be support in addiction, not just a leaflet. Skills development, so inmates have a chance to work when they leave prison."
"Honestly it‚Äôs mostly because we run for profit prisons over here, so they don‚Äôt care about rehabilitation... just how to run things as cheaply as possible."
"Prison should be somewhat of a deterant, but mostly rehabilitation. If we knew someone would never commit another crime again, the best outcome would be to let them off free."
If you word it like this I‚Äòm really asking myself who the bad guys are.
"I can't imagine how harsh a punishment it would be to be restricted to a room/prison facility for many years. Not being able to travel and having your life years being spent doing the same things repeatedly seems horrible already. Close I ever got were the countless days/nights spent at university to study. I hated those times, friends were the only thing after finals to help relieve."
It‚Äôs not that we‚Äôd rather see them suffer. It‚Äôs more that people make money off of their suffering so they want to keep people in jail longer.
">We‚Äôd rather see a bad person suffer than see them not be a bad person anymore

It's easy to make yourself feel morally superior by saying things like that but once you see a person actually murdering someone innocent or raping someone you quickly lose your desire to put them in nice comfy hotel rooms. People who go for lesser offenses like thieves and **some** murderers, sure those should be rehabilitated, but many people just don't deserve it."
Absolutely
"I‚Äôm not trying to defend it in any way but before we hop on this bandwagon: approx. 7 percent of state prisoners and 18 percent of federal prisoners are for-profit


Source: https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/mass-incarceration/private-prisons"
"A pretty small percentage, yes (still not a good system though). But I would argue the bigger problems are a) politicians wanting to get votes/approval by being hard on X, resulting in many people going to jail for stupid reasons and b) employers being able to find out if someone has been to jail before. Very few people want to hire criminals, even ones who have completed their sentence with no issues. The end result is that a lot of them will have no choice but to turn back to crime."
This jail is sponsored by McDonald's. Mm mm good.. In confinement.
I think only like 10% of prisons are privately owned?
"Which makes no fucking sense. Those are the same people who bitch and moan about people on welfare without realizing that prisoners are way more expensive.

They'd rather continually punish someone who makes a mistake and pay for everything for them through taxes than they would that person be rehabilitated, reintroduced into society, and turned into a contributor that pays taxes rather than a burden. Those people are psychos IMO. They'd rather hurt than help, plain and simple."
"Why not both? 

All non violent prisoners go to prisons like this and violent prisoners go to normal prisons where they have to earn the nice one."
"It's too bad the American general public would never accept that. Even with concrete proof (80% recidivism vs 20%) they've been brainwashed by politicians and the media to think that ""people convicted of crimes are evil and don't deserve to be treated like humans"" because the politicians are paid by the people who run for profit prisons to brainwash the general population of that in order to keep recidivism high and profits rolling in.

Hell, they arrest people to build a slave force too. That way they can take on cheap government and private contracts, use prisons to complete the work and pay them like 5 dollars a day. Shawshank Redemption, though the story itself fake, is actually a commentary on modern American prison."
"Yeah, Norway has the most humane prisons in the world. It's crazy how treating people like people keeps them acting like, you know, people."
Isn‚Äôt only 1 prison in Norway that‚Äôs actually like that? And the rest are pretty much like swedish ones?
Maybe this is all an Ikea Commerical
It's not an unpopular opinion at all. Most people understand that a different country has different laws that do not have to abide by US sentiments. Social media likes to campaign for famous peoples freedom regardless of the circumstances.
The way he was kicking the shit out of that bloke made me sick; we don‚Äôt need people that behave like that. I hope they throw the book at him.
"People want to stay in shitty bare concrete cell prisons too, despite how horrible it is there. The places in the images aren't exactly good, they're tiny shared areas without freedom or privacy."
">when I‚Äôm out I‚Äôm seen as a prisoner and nothing more, my life is better inside because I can get anything I want

See the thing about country's that have prisons like this is they actually treat their prisons like humans they whole time while also believing they can be rehabilitated. For sure, why would your buddy want to stay out of prison when he can't do shit in the real world because ""ex con"" is permanently attached to his name.

But that's not the norm, that's America. I can say with full confidence that if your pal was given liberties that other former inmates in these countries get (ie they actually have rights and can get decent jobs) he would rather stay on the outside where he has freedom to do what he wants and can actually see his family.

Don't think prison reform stops with changing the cells, we need to fix the whole damn system. Stop treating ex cons like animals and start helping them get back on their feet. It makes much more sense to have a productive, tax paying member of society than it does another prisoner who is just a burden on the tax system, but until the whole system is fixed recidivism will stay at 80%"
They use a tiered prison system. Facilities like the one in the op are the final stage and are for those about to be released. The earlier stages are more reminiscent of what you might image.
"So which scenario does the greatest good for the greatest number of people? Don't you think there's too much focus on the punishment part of the whole thing? And, for offenders who are supposed to get out at some point, nothing about the current system is in society's best interest. 

You further compound that with the stigma of being an ex-con. You get denied many rights others get (some states deny voting rights) and you struggle to find employment. It's just all too easy to push people to go back to being criminals."
"Florida criminal defense lawyer here. Florida actually has language built into its criminal statutes/code that the primary purpose of the justice system IS punishment. Not rehabilitation. Not deterrence. Punishment. Judges like to cite to it when handing out draconian sentences. Florida also eliminated parole a long time ago, so life = life, only leaving prison in your own casket. Any first degree murder conviction for a non-juvenile requires you to die in prison. Pretty crazy. I‚Äôve spent a lot of time in prisons. They aren‚Äôt pretty."
"What‚Äôs wrong is that ya‚Äôll look at this picture and think **‚Äùoh wow it‚Äôs just like us!‚Äù** when you‚Äôre 1. only looking at surface value, & 2. Only looking at one picture that shows very little, when hundreds of other predicaments could be pictured and we‚Äôd be mortified.

Having a room like this doesn‚Äôt make prison a non-deterrent and that is downright stupid to think so. 

They still can‚Äôt see their family, and can only talk to them at certain hours. They still have cell mates. They still deal with prison drama/politics that is some stuff nobody can fathom unless they‚Äôve been through it. They still always have to walk around with an eye over their shoulder. It is such a stupid fucking mentality that they should be locked up like an animal - and that is exactly what people like you campaign for."
"The three roles of prison are:

1. Protection of society, which is handled by forcibly removing the offender from society.

2. Punishment, which is accomplished by striping and/or limiting prisoners freedoms and rights.

3. Rehabilitation, which is where the US is failing.

Prison doesn't work as a deterrent for people like you met because the alternative is to be homeless, starved, and uncared for. To them, having a few freedoms and rights taken from them is worth not having to fight the world to live. A lot of those people you'll also find have mental health issues that make it hard for them to provide for themselves and function properly within society. Which explains some of the mindset.

I think there are three major steps that this country needs to take to not only decrease the amount of repeat offenders, but also decrease the number of people going to prison in the first place.

1. Put an end to private prisons. Don't give anyone an incentive to put people in prison by making it a money making business.

2. Mental health needs to be taken even more seriously than our physical health. No more shaming people for seeking help to better themselves. This should also include the decriminalization of drug use. This would eliminate a large portion of the prison population, and is a victimless crime that should have never gotten more than a fine or a day or two in jail.

3. Income equality. A large portion of the inmate population turn to crime for financial gain. A lot of those people have no way to provide for themselves or their families within normal means, and resort to drug dealing, prostitution, and theft to do so. Get rid of the incentive and you eliminate the crime."
Also having your freedom restricted and losing a portion of your life *is* the punishment.
"Both Norway and Sweden have high security prisons as well. 
They are more reminiscent of your normal prisons."
"You can believe that someone who is known to attack people won't be able to interact with others like that. Breivik is in solitary confinement, for example."
You can handle deadly violent persons but treat them as human beeings at the same time. You can still treat them good and not let them take advantage of you.
How dumb do you have to be to think Sweden sends their child rape murderers to one of these type of prisons?
"It's perfectly possible to have maximum security facilities and contain dangerous criminals who are serving life, without treating them worse than animals = making it absolutely impossible for any type of rehabilitation ever."
"Sometimes it doesn't mean a thing to certain criminals, sure. So why torture or continue to punish them? Being cast away from the rest of society makes the rest of society safer from the few sociopaths you describe.

We still don't have to treat them more poorly outside of their sentencing - EVER.

It's not only about how the inmate feels, it's about what we're doing, if we're held accountable, and if it's actually yielding positive results for society."
Those people you talk about are at best 5% of everyone whos in jail.
"Please tell us, specifically, what is harsh or inhuman about Kronobergsh√§ktet?"

"To be clear, Sweden is being criticized for holding arrested criminals in jail for an indeterminate time while prosecutors decide how to pursue charges. Not for the actual living conditions in jail (though it would be somewhat simpler than the cells pictured here)."
The jails was mostly criticised for having long detention periods rather than being inhuman

"> but it is really delusional to think everyone can be rehabilitated. 

Nobody thinks that, not even in Sweden."
">Ted Bundy. John Wayne Gacy. People who raped and tortured kids to death.

And how many percent of criminals commit acts of that magnitude? Such a tiny percentage of prisoners are serial killers and rapists of the JWG kind, saying that all prisoners should be punished rather than rehabilitated, regardless of what crime landed them in prison, because of a small fraction of offenders is stupid."
He didn't. TMZ did.
Imagine rapists going to jail- prison is for marijuana snorters please
"Most of the [US prison population](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=6546) is in for drug offenses and weapon's/arson/explosives, sex offenders make up about 8% of the population. We are plainly creating not only the worlds most [repetitive](https://www.nij.gov/topics/corrections/recidivism/pages/welcome.aspx) and [largest incarcerated population](https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=tp&tid=11) in world history, but comments like yours are insinuating that all crime is equal and that state revenge is the goal, not actual Justice. It uses the rarest yet most offensive examples to frame an entire argument. 

Our prison system and drug policy is the most glaring example of opressive and overzealous government in recent memory. It's counterproductive and creates more crime and destroys lives needlessly. Other countries have had success in these areas, wisdom says to listen to their ideas."
"49% of prisoners are in there for non-violent crime - including drug use. Yet, you are here saying they should be locked up in the same conditions as rapists.

Oh, what? Is that a strawman? Well, if you can use one, then so can I."
"My rapist is in one of those jails. And I'm very pleased with it. 

He might be a human piece of garbage, but I still prefer the chance of him being a rehabilitated person who understands what he did wrong, and becomes a better person who contributes to society instead of becoming a person with extremely high rate of re-offending, and hurting other people. 

(And no, I don't want him dead, I don't believe in the death penalty.)"
"I get it. You want them to feel as awful as your daughter does. But I want them to not rape people anymore, or worse, turn to more violent means. Punitive justice offers criminals no way out and makes them worse. If we‚Äôre gonna do that, we might as well just kill them, and if we did that, were no better than animals.

I think we‚Äôre capable of a lot more than base instinct. I think we can rehabilitate people and indebt them to their state for the rest of their lives. A rapist could sit and rot in jail, or spend their live being a productive member of society and have to do volunteer work for the government all the time."
"Your daughter has already been raped.  Fucking up his life and mind even more isn't gonna make her get unraped.  It probably will make the guy more likely to rape someone else's daughter or worse after he gets out though.

From a personal standpoint, I wouldn't want the person in any jail, I'd want him dead.  From a societal standpoint, we want actual rehabilitation and less reoffenders.  My personal need for revenge means nothing to society."
"Your problem is going to be with the state, how can they really get justice for a ‚Äúdaughter‚Äù that was raped?  Most laws say throw a rapist in prison for 20-30 years.

Her mental state, ability to connect emotionally and sexually with others could be ruined for life, not just 20-40 years. 

At least if the state truly tries to rehabilitate over the 20-40 years they can ensure that the offender never does it again.  It might seem soft to you, but the data shows it works.

Now if the state throws a person in a hole for the same amount of time, yeah the offender will suffer but are they more or less likely to commit the crime?  We both know the answer because look at the recidivism rates by country.  Norway low (around 20%). US high around 80%.

So my friend, if you are ever faced with that situation when someone you love is raped, get your own justice find a knife and cut what needs to be cut....but for policy that I want my government to use I‚Äôm going with rehab."
Sweden has high-security prisons like ours. These are mainly for low-level offenders.
Imagine being so dumb that you think child rapists are the type that they send to these types of prisons in Sweden.
I think there are certain crimes that you should lose your chance at freedom and rehabilitation for. This place is fine for drug offenders but rapists and murderers dont really deserve that second chance.
Imagine having more prisoners than any country in the world because people think prisons should be about revenge instead of making us all safer from future bad behavior.

School is prison; confirmed
I was a student in the US and i know for a fact that most of the dorm buildings on my campus were designed by a prison architect.
"Hold up, y'all got shower in your uni rooms?

Edit: Lemme add, I'm in the states (Michigan), I went to the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) and I had to share the bathroom and shower with my whole floor."
My cousin graduated this year from an expensive private university in the states and none of her rooms over the years have looked as nice as this
IKEA probably makes it lmaooo
I genuinely think bottom right might be a picture of plymouth uni accommodation.
Your dorm room had a shower!?
"Someone from outside the US:

>Even the worst countries don‚Äôt have X

United States: 

>Has X"
"As an American, the longer I spend on the internet, the more I realize how much America fucking sucks."
I shared a bathroom with 40 dudes and sometimes their girlfriends and no ac
Wow you have had a luxurious room.
"The reason this is the case is because the bathrooms in most modern uni halls, and most likely modern prisons, is essentially just a big module that gets placed and then the room gets built around it. Unis and prisons like them because everything about them will be exactly the same in each one, meaning repairs and replacements are incredibly easy. 

On top of that, there's basically one or two companies that maintain a monopoly on the construction of these modules, meaning that it's incredibly likely that a bathroom in one place will look almost identical to the bathroom in another place."
U have showers what.
From the US and that‚Äôs so much bigger than my dorm room. We just had two beds and two desks with public bathrooms.
I'm about ¬£50k in debt with my student loans. Graduated  in 2017.
"Lol, these rooms would cost like ¬£140-150 a week at my uniüò≠"
Fucking hell. There were 3 of us in one room (only 1 internet connection) and one large bathroom for 15 rooms. 2 washers and 2 dryers for the whole floor of 25 rooms.
Did you got to Pompey? They legit used old womens prison digs as uni accomodation
It is possible that those are dorm rooms and OP is lying.
"from the UK too, that's better than my uni accommodation."
"If it‚Äôs any consolation, it‚Äôs also what Swedish student accommodation looks like."
Holy shit it is mine too
 It re-education get it?
My favorite part of your comment is that the cost of university has gone down in the last 10 years. Crying in American.
"By the time I'm out it's going to be more like ¬£50,000 :'("
Ohh man in America I have to share a dorm room with another guy and the bathrooms are shared between 6 people. And I'm paying a fuck ton for this accommodation and degree
I don't think I would have gone to uni if I'd have had to share a room.
"I wish we didn‚Äôt have to share rooms. Like yea usually after freshman year, most people move into on/off campus apartments where they get their own room. But freshman dorms are rough. They‚Äôll have your ass in a small ass box with somebody else across from you. And that was lucky when I was a freshman in 2017, I chose the room with the private bathroom and it was great, just me and my roommate. Everyone else had suite style rooms, so it‚Äôs basically like two rooms connected to each other if you go through the bathroom. 4 people sharing a bathroom/shower, and you can easily go into the other room by just walking through the bathroom."
"Total 18k. Total.
Total Americans.
Total."
Holy crap. I'm not sure sure the US even matches most of these
"That sounds nice.

yo that‚Äôs a question i have is everyone just horny all the time in college

Ugh, don't remind me.... ^Forever ^^ever ^^^ever ^^^^alone..."
You have to pay extra for a double room?? At my university (US) we had to pay like 150% of the regular dorm price for the privilege of a single room
God damn. 40k for a degree. USC here in the states is 75k a year.
Should have went to collage
Hold up. So you‚Äôre telling me you went to college for less AND got leagues better accommodations. God damn America is bullshit

the US has this. its called work release
"All prisons. It's towards the end of your sentence to prepare you for your actual release and to grt ypu ready for freedom. 

ASAP probably won't get a long enough sentence to get one of these days though, if he gets prison time at all. As much as we all feel like he was justified in his actions (from the little we've seen), he still committed a crime and that comes with a cost. Sucks for his fans and his wallet."
Like Epstein?
"I love in the doc [Breaking the Cycle](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuLQ4gqB5XE) (where the director from Halden visits american prisons), where they ask some american inmates to ""design"" their perfect prison.

When the prisoners was done, the Halden director went up, drew a wall around their design and did two more changes i think it was, and said ""This is Halden prison"".

It is a good watch, i'd recommend it."
That guy made me sad. He has such little empathy for a person who is supposed to be in charge of peoples' futures.
That's when you don't run a prison like a shitty business.

I don't know about Sweden but here in Norway most of them are like this.
Do you remember the name of the show?
And raped. Can't forget raped.
That's because America unofficially decided removal from society was more important than rehabilitation.
Welcome to information warfare

"It is simple, one is the logical reaction and the other is the emotional one. When I read about somebody doing something awful my initial reaction is wanting them to suffer. Disconnect a bit from the situation, think over it and you see why it is a bad idea.

This is also exactly why vigilante justice is illegal"
"That part is too small in the US. Too many people have hate boners for anyone deemed a criminal. It becomes a lot about feeling morally superior and ""bringing justice""."
"This, absolutely. If jailing people is profitable there‚Äôs a counter interest to ensuring they are actually rehabilitated, not to mention a ‚Äúrace to the bottom‚Äù effect of capitalism trying to make as much money as they can off incarcerating someone while the government is trying to spend as little as possible on it.

But it‚Äôs still fucking weird and gross."
Such a small percentage of prisons are actually private for profit business that it barely moves the meter.
"Yeah that‚Äôs a really wild one. I mean, punitive justice is already pretty fucked but we try to pretend like there‚Äôs a ‚Äúgood way‚Äù to put someone to death (that same cognitive dissonance that lives alongside ‚Äúrules of war‚Äù), but I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs anything but the most horrific and brutal punishment anyone could ever receive. 

I‚Äôd be willing to bet most death row inmates would be willing to be tortured for an extended period of time than have the death penalty, but there‚Äôs no way we‚Äôd allow, as a society, someone to be tortured. It‚Äôs weird that we don‚Äôt have the stomach to hurt, but we do have one to kill."
"People just feel that if there is a rabid dog, you should be able to put it down and end the matter. In practice and concept, you're right. But that's how people *feel*."
"I personally don‚Äôt have a problem with the idea of a death penalty. There are some crimes that are so bad that the punishment fits, or where rehabilitation is not an option. 

But until we can make that process fair and humane it should never be used. And America does not make it fair and humane. Even ignoring the inherent racial and gender biases in the system, doctors are (or at least were, haven‚Äôt heard any updates on this) refusing to provide the normal chemical cocktail for lethal injections so some prisons were just freestyling it with random shit causing immense pain and slow death. That is inhuman to me."
"Now what if I went ahead and took that hypothetical concern and put a name, let‚Äôs say [Cameron Todd Willingham](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameron_Todd_Willingham), to it?"
"To add to that, the cities that decide to try to help people off the streets get stuck with the burden of homeless that wander from other cities that don't. It's really a bummer."
"It's all echoes of the Dickensian workhouse. The people who 'fail', who are too poor or break the law, do so out of weakness, and that weakness has to be strained and beaten out of them."
"You can be hard on crime and still work to actually rehabilitate offenders so when they get out they don't commit more crime.

Really that is more Hard on crime than the just being sadistic to the criminals so they come out all kinds of fucked in the head."
"Most people turn to crime because they ran out of options. I‚Äôm not sure if rehab-forward imprisonment would work in every situation (there‚Äôs no silver bullet), but id be willing to bet it would work in 90% of cases."
"So hundreds of thousands of people, given America's 2.3 million prison population. That's pretty terrifying.   
  
Also, a huge part of the problem is the lobbying and influence those companies have when their vested interest is to get more prisoners."
">I‚Äôm not trying to defend it in any way but before we hop on this bandwagon: approx. 7 percent of state prisoners and 18 percent of federal prisoners are for-profit

And how many non-profit public prisons use services provided by for-profit private industries?

The private prison industry isn't just about prisons that are 100% privately run. It's about private food suppliers that rely on prisons to buy their product. It's about private security contractors that rely on understaffed public prisons to employ their laborers. It's about private bail bondsmen that rely on inflated bail amounts. It's about every single private organization that profits from more people being in prison, regardless of whether they run the prison themselves or not.

As long as that profit motive is there those companies will continue to lobby for longer sentences, more recidivism, and worse conditions. And they'll absolutely use existing trends of racism and bigotry to further those goals."
that doesnt come across as defending it as this number is still way too high
That's still way too many though
Should be 0%.
"Right, but even if there were no private prisons, the US is so obsessed with job loss that a public prison system that decreased recidivism would be vilified when a prison closed. Being unemployed is pretty much viewed as halfway to jail in the US."
"You do know that all the employees of a not for profit business still get paid, the company itself just doesn‚Äôt profit. This means that the upper management could be making a killing off of these prisons."
"That's what happens when you grow up without being taught what empathy is. These people get enjoyment out of seeing prisoners suffer, then when they get out of jail, the same people punish them even more by not allowing them to reintegrate into society. It's fucked up, I'm so glad I don't live in the USA."
"Read up on convict leasing. It was even worse, and just slavery by another name. It preceded the system that exists now."
"Only one state of the art prison like this yeah, Halden Prison, but theres also Bast√∏y, maybe not as state of the art, but its an island that looks like paradise so yeah we got more where those came from. Sweden has nice prisons, but they also have very heavy security american style prisons as well, but probably without the violence etc."
"Yeah that‚Äôs a fair point, the cell probably isn‚Äôt going to make or break their mentality regardless. But that prisoner‚Äôs view is something that‚Äôs always stuck with me - ultimately the system inside can be better than what‚Äôs outside and a lot of people can learn to survive in prison instead of being determined to leave and I think little things like having a TV in your cell can impact on that. Although I‚Äôve not seen the science behind it so I‚Äôm basing this on thought more than research."
"This is just conjecture but I have the impression that some repeat offenders share that sentiment regardless of what country they're incarcerated in; dealing with the raw codes of a microcosm of criminals and gang hierarchy, can be more comfortable for some people than being a deviant at large in the wider world of infinite subcultures, where the most important rule is to not palpably seem antisocial or like a cheater. 

That said, are some societies structured to push people to the margins and keep them there? Absolutely. But as long as crime pays, there will be people who feel more at home in a criminal underworld, in or out of captivity."

"I'm gonna ask this question with an open mind to having my opinion changed. Why is it crazy that someone who has murdered (premeditated) should serve a true life sentence? 

I don't see how the act of taking a life can ever be repaid - there is no retribution enough for the victim, the victim's family and society. I am also not convinced by the rehabilitation argument in this case: most murder is not a repeat offence caused by a social maladaptation where I could see the point of spending resources to avoid reoffence. 

The thought of murderers walking free while their victim rots offends my moral sense to the core but I'm open to hearing the other side."

Yeah some halls do offer private bathrooms. Some come shared still but I'd say it's less common now.
"Most uni rooms now have a bathroom included in them. I haven‚Äôt seen a shared bathroom at uni unless it was in a second, third or fourth year shared house."
When you're applying for accommodation you get to choose between ensuite rooms or shared bathrooms. The ensuite ones usually have higher rent.
"In the UK, we have like en-suite uni rooms. If you want to sacrifice a little more of your grant for a private bathroom, this is usually in first year as in second year you move into a house with shared bathrooms, but the option to have a shared bathroom is still something available in first year."

From what I've seen, some schools now have the option for a double with a bath, or two doubles with a bath in between. However, you have to clean them yourself. The only school I've seen where they clean them for you is Texas A&M."
"Most university are upgrading to the quad style with bathroom. Everyone gets their own room. Welcome to club med U.

My son starting uni in the fall. üò≠üò≠üò≠"
I went to camp there. Can confirm.
"Yep, I go to a Canadian university and in my first year I had to share a room with someone else, and also showers/toilets with the entire floor."
depends on which dorm u go to
on the application for u of m housing now it asks if you prefer your own bathroom or a shared one. Most people put shared so they don't have to clean it
If there's more than 5 people per floor then that's disgusting. Prison design.
Also went to U of M. Our dorm showers were fucking nasty
"I was in the navy we had 90 men berthing with 2 heads & 1 shower.  Top that.  Oh & limited fresh water, you have to pull a handle for water when you shower."
I went to the University of South Carolina and lived on campus for three years. I had an en-suite bathroom all three years.
"That‚Äôs a pretty damn good university too, as far as public schools in the states go. Almost went there, it was my second choice. Out of state tuition woulda killed me tho."
SLAMM√òR
"In the UK, unis offer en-suite shower rooms in halls. You can often get a shared bathroom if you want, which usually has a lower rent."
"minus the private restroom, most dorms look like that and cost about that much at pubic universities.

The things that make America suck are the things that make it super good at some stuff.  Business and innovation are two things that thrive in a work as much as possible until you're dead culture. Everything from our educational system and power structure reinforce the idea that there is no chill it's either fully-on or dead.
Same with hotels. It's all pre-fabs for quick construction
Yes. In the UK you almost always have showers in your university dorm room. It's also worth mentioning that 3 years of study and accommodation left me about ¬£14k in debt. I have no idea how US students tolerate the cost of college education tbh
Nobody is met has shared a room whilst being in a  UK university. Even the worst universities I saw didn't have shared bedrooms. I'm sure they exist though.
"Or they pay you to go to uni, like they do here in Scotland. My dorm room looked like these pictures and it cost me ¬£480 a month, but the government payed me ¬£600 so it was free and so was the tuition."
Yes. It's ridiculous.
8k!!! Where did you go to school?!
"Well as far as Sweden goes we have √ñppenanstalt (open prison) and that means there is nothing in the way to hinder a escape just a sign that tells you where the prison grounds end. It comes with high levels of freedom but also restrictions to when and why you can leave but the general idea is to allow a larger amount of freedom for individuals that are not seen as threats to society as to not alienate them from the society they failed by breaking the law. 

It's not something for just the rich as some other posters have implied"
"At least in Finland afaik it's even for violence-related offences, but only toward the end of their sentence. Same for people convicted of non-violent crimes, it's a sort of final stage before release. Of course good behavious while still in the regular prisons is a prerequisite."
"I'm not the person you asked, but when I toured a jail as a kid in Colorado, there were groups of prisoners that got to go out and go to work at their usual jobs during the day, but they had to return afterwards.  It definitely was reserved for non-violent offenders in that case."
"For federal prisons, they're called Camps.  Usually part of a low security FCI facility"
"In germany, that's used for prisoners that are considered no particular risk - be it for attempts to escape, to serve an addiction, or to commit further crimes. So long as you reliably show up every evening on time and sober, you're free to leave again in the morning and go to your normal job. You may also be permitted to stay with your family on weekends.

Wikipedia has outdated numbers, but a few years ago 16% of prisoners were ""held"" with that model."
"I just watched it. And as a Norwegian, I can't even begin to fathom the realities of American prison inmates. To me, Norwegian prisons seem like the norm, and anything less is inhumane. The only change the Halden director made besides the wall was moving the showers inside the individual rooms."
"Thanks for the recommendation, that was awesome."
"Yeah, he puts up walls, takes the phone out of the room, and puts the shower in the cell.

He articulates that ""freedom"" is what is being restricted while in prison.

That's the punishment. Your time isn't actually *yours*. 

By grouping prisoners together in a clean, safe, and comfortable environment, they tend to ""self police"" and keep themselves honest.

Sure, they give the prisoners a lot of trust, but it gets paid back in full by them being appreciative and cooperative.

If your CO isn't your enemy, you're not going to want to stab him in his neck.

Also, they have recourse for serious violent offenders that don't play by their rules."
I LOVE that doc!
"In his mind he's in charge of people's punishment, not future. Which is sad."
"Here's the thing, this guy is talking about the inmates like they're all violent offenders. When he knows for a fact that's not the case."
"We would see this in America, if America was all-white.  We have more sympathy for our own races.  Hence why white the juducal system will throw the book at blacks and mexicans, but give a slap on the wrist to whites for the same crimes."
Why the F would you equip a stadium with a holding cell
As long as we have enough to pay for it anyway.
"World‚Äôs Toughest Prisons (ironic, I know). I think it‚Äôs like episode 3 or something like that. Can‚Äôt verify right now."
"I want to say it was ‚ÄúThe worlds toughest prisons‚Äù. 

Which is odd bc it was a super nice prison."
"This is one of the worst parts of reddit. I regularly see comments wishing rape on criminals and making prison rape jokes. I can‚Äôt imagine wishing rape on anyone. 

I mean, I don‚Äôt like the idea of the man that murdered my close friend being able to play video games and watch tv in his room like this prison, but even him I don‚Äôt want *raped.* There‚Äôs something so sadistic about that."
"You can't lump all criminals into a single group. If someone in their late teens/early 20s robs a gas station, that person can probably be rehabilitated. If someone kills a child, personally, I'm not really interested in that persons rehabilitation.

I'm not sure where the notion came from that prison is supposed to be solely about rehabilitation. Prison is a place you go to because you've (in most cases) knowingly broken the law of whatever region you live in, and have been sent to prison as a consequence of that crime. Actions must have consequences in our society or we'll quickly slide into chaos.

Rehabilitation is great if for no other reason that to mitigate the amount of re-offenders, but that's not why a person has been sent to prison."
"Why not both, Australia technically turned out fine. We could send all our criminals to Florida, it has a head start"
"I've seen so many people that worship Sheriff Joe, it's disgusting."
"Yeah but I see posts like ""nazis deserve to be killed"" (not a bad statement). Then I see posts like this one."
I think you misspoke. America determined that punishment was more important than rehabilitation. But the whole notion of ‚Äújail‚Äù is removal from society for some amount of time. This picture of Sweden shows people removed from society.
"However, there is validity to want 
 justice if you are the victim, or the victim of a similar crime."
"I can agree with that. We need to value the rehabilitation part more.  Instead, at the federal level, Congress expressly rejected rehabilitation as a policy sometime in the 80s (I don't recall if they ever brought it back). And I guess various states balance things differently, each in their own ways. But yes, rehabilitation isn't valued much in this country. 

I mostly just take issue with the extremely naive and oft-repeated statement that jail should be about rehabilitation. As if there were something wrong with wanting criminals to suffer, which we all want too, whether we want to be honest about it or not."
"I get tired of people blaming all of the heartless people that want to see people suffer. Sure, that argument works when talking about murderers and Brock Turners but most people don't want to see a drug addict or drug dealer severely punished. This has been all about money, blaming everyday people as opposed to greedy people in power is exactly how this type of treatment continues."
"I was watching a prison documentary a while ago that said that a lot of prisoners will try to do something to get the Death Penalty if they're in there for life, simply because Death Penalty prisons are federal prisons and have much better conditions than private prisons. Death Row is not a quick process, so they spend quite a while there before actually being killed. But they are choosing better conditions and eventual death over living the way the private prison would make them for the remainder of their life. 

Just something to think about. It is definitely something I've thought about it a lot."
"It's even worse when the ""good"" ways to die are for the sake of the onlookers.

Things like lethal injection are used because they are less gruesome then say a guillotine. Even though the guillotine is still probably your best bet for a quick death"
"Speaking of a ""good way to put someone to death"", you should check out John Oliver's report on that topic...."
">but there‚Äôs no way we‚Äôd allow, as a society, someone to be tortured.

Guantanamo?"
We ought to be better than emotionally reactive creatures. Ascend our nature.
"Personally, I think it should be done by firing squad. We are here to kill a man. Taking the most precious thing from them. For those watching it should not look peacefull, it should not be easy to see, it should be a stark reminder we are killing someone, not trick you into thinking they are falling asleep. For the prisoner, it should be quick and relativly painless. Firing squad fills these requirements.

Same might say it is barbaric, and I agree. Taking someones life is barbaric."
"What's the point in killing a ""horrible person"" other than to make you feel better? What good does it actually do?"
How would you feel if you were wrongfully convicted? Or framed by the cops. The Supreme Court stopped executions for years because it was racist. The court changed to having one more conservative member and suddenly it was ok again. They made minor changes that didn‚Äôt stop the state from using systemic racism to murder innocent people.
"So... are you trying to argue that people like him deserve to die for their actions? I wouldn‚Äôt agree with you, even if your example was someone who actually did the crime. 

Cameron Todd Willingham wasn‚Äôt a squeaky clean individual, but I think it‚Äôs fucking horrifying that he was executed for a crime that he very, VERY likely didn‚Äôt commit."
"Well, as far as I understand it the Swedish system is is actually quite tough on crime. They're just not tough on the criminals.

The point isn't about hurting the people responsible for bad things. It's about making sure crime doesn't pay off. And that's done by making sure every infraction is prosecuted. That's for example one reason why the Swedish crime statistics show so many rapes. In Sweden victims are simply a magnitude more likely to go to the police than in most places."
"Yeah I'm not sure how things are in Sweden, but from an outsider it appears as if they have less social economic issues resulting in crime. I think these prisons help decrease re-offenders, but I don't think crime was that high to begin with. You can afford to spend more on each prisoner if there aren't that many to begin with, this wouldn't scale well at all to the US's prison population."
.... you guys have 2.3 million people in prison???? That's over one percent of the adult population!
"It's too many, yes, but it can't explain the entire system in a broad strokes like the original comment was.suggesting."
"Same here on that last sentence lmao. People like to say 'well they commited a crime, they should suffer!' and justify a lot of vitriol towards prisoners that way. Many people won't understand til they have a family or friend convicted for a none-violent crime and still recieved that same level of vitriol."
"You have a fair point but as this is in sweden its invalid

Even poor people have this or higher living standard with all our government support programs
If you are in worse conditions you only have yourself to blame usually for not meeting the very soft requirements for support/work.
Sadly a lot of people exploit these programs but thats a disscusion for another time.

All in all living standards in sweden is high."
"now here's the second part of scandinavian punishment, we have a welfare structure that promises that you can enjoy a minimum quality of life whether or not you are employed, meaning they will be able to get a similar, or maybe slightly worse or better depending on where they settle, no matter what and they will be able to live no matter what. Sometimes this support requires that they apply for jobs for many hours of the day, but they will have the income to live."
"True. But how do you explain America‚Äôs abnormally high recidivism rates then? Because our countries recidivism rate is 80%. The UKs is 30%, and Sweden hovers around 40%. Both of those countries don‚Äôt treat prison as primarily a punishment. The US does. Huh. I wonder why more than double our prisoners return to prisoners vs other countries. Personally, I‚Äôd rather our society be focused on not having people return to prison. But the numbers seem to say that we want it, and people like you in this thread also support the philosophy driving this insanely high number. Why do y‚Äôall like paying for so many repeat prisoners? It‚Äôs literally a direct drain on your money, but nope, prison needs to be about punishment, so that 80% isn‚Äôt going anywhere."
"Drug addiction is a medical/mental problem not a criminal one, change my mind."

"Well the schools need to meet some serious regulations in terms of furniture. Everything needs to be fireproofed, mattresses need to be cleanable between residents. 

There aren't many manufacturers out there making this stuff, and those that do accommodate both the prison and student housing industry."
"I remember moving out of my dorm and moving the furniture around, then flipping a bookshelf around to see that there was a label on it saying it was made at one of the local prisons...it never occurred to me that prisoners made it but it's a pretty common thing here."
"Some guy 50 years ago who had never made furniture in his life hammered 4 pieces of the heaviest, hardest wood possible together in the vague shape of a chair, desk and bed, and every college in America was like yes pleases we‚Äôll take 10,000 of those."
My college had a choice between either the old school communal showers and the ones in your room... I actually chose the communal one because a) it forced me to be more social and b) they got cleaned every day
West quad! I graduated in 2013.
LSU cleans them for you once a week when I was there in 2017!
"Ohio University has this in four dorm buildings now. It‚Äôs either a bathroom between two doubles or between two singles.

In the dorm I lived in, each floor had two ‚Äúmods‚Äù, or halves of the floor. Each mod had three hallways, and each hallway had any combination of singles or doubles that always added up to 6 people. Each hallway also had its own bathroom, so there were 6 people to a bathroom. It wasn‚Äôt the best but it was a far cry better than communal bathrooms shared by the entire floor in other dorms.

This mod-style dorm only exists in OU‚Äôs South Green, which is being torn down bit by bit. RIP Dirty South."
We don't use √∏ in Sweden since we're not Danish. √ñ please!
"The UK has by far the most expensive education in the EU. In most countries it‚Äôs free and the ones that do charge, charge a lot less."
"Indian student here. My whole college education costed about ‚Çπ700,000(‚âà‚Ç¨7000 don't worry about the conversion the value I said is very approximate). And my hostels had common bathrooms without shower and pretty shitty in terms of hygiene. So I sacrificed a lot of comfort.

But at least I don't have any debts(or even a mild financial stress)"
Not in all of the UK. In Scotland they payed me to go to uni. I got about ¬£600 a month. Plus free tuition.
Wow that‚Äôs crazy. At my university all rooms were two person except for the corner rooms they were much larger and were for 3 people but they changed it to two people my second year and just charged extra. And also the entire floor (around 40 people) shared 8 showers.
"They existed in Edinburgh, they were super cheap though. They were in some of the self catered flats, not the proper halls."
Obviously in the US. I didn't dorm but my public University was about the same.
"They do this in the UK too. Have one near my home, never had a problem tbh, even spoke to a few of them. I asked one of them wouldnt people just run away and he replied that whats the point, most of them are towards the end of their sentences anyways."
"Sounds strange at first, but really they would be free to walk out side at some point anyway when they would be released."
"In Canada we have things called halfway houses.  They're for the same purpose I think.  You're still under restrictions and have guidance and rules,  but it's in a shared home and usually in a normal neighborhood."
"America has this, too, it‚Äôs just not a direct part of the prisons. They‚Äôre called halfway homes."
"Have the same thing in Britain as well, the closer to the end of the sentence you're allowed more and more time away from prison as well as weekends and such you're allowed to go home for etc."
"I think racism is fundamentally an expression of hate, and that putting down other people is an easy way to deal with that hate.

Society has moved on from slavery, the most inhumane way to treat people now, to get that fix, is the conditions we put inmates.

The color of your skin, being a convicted criminal, being gay - these are all easy targets of hate. 

As far as I see it, places like Norway simply have a higher standard of living. People eat better, sleep longer and exercise more, this is the foundation a healthy mind needs to create a happy person. 

Truly happy people don't need that cheap release to feel better, their brain is doing that naturally. Heck I'm tempted to attribute WW2 to hungry Germans honestly."
"Well, we can‚Äôt let one little rape charge ruin a young (white) man‚Äôs life. Think of the ramifications it would have on him down the road!"
"I think you‚Äôre underselling the impact of class and race together, but your point is well taken."
"It's much less about race and much more about status.  Poor white folks get thrown in with the rest, wealthy white folks are given leniency."
"Or hire more brown people, or pay us equally, or, or, or, the list never ends dude. That‚Äôs what hurts the most"
"Do people think there or only White people in Sweden?

I guess you a refering to the Halden episode it's in Norway but a understandable miss on the country. Halden is not a for the rich only or a invite only type of deal.
"Ohhh I think I remember watching this. They had Russian prisons as well, right?"
"Yeah if there's *anything* Reddit is famous for, it's the fucking eight thousand shameless Prison Rape jokes on literally any article where a person (especially men for some reason) does some sort of infraction or is going to court.

I know reddit isn't one person, but goddamn is it jarring to see ""Prison shouldn't be about revenge"" championed in one thread and then see ""I hope he gets a train run on him"" in another. Yikes."
"Murderers, rapists, and other extremely violent crime are such a small subset of criminals though. I feel like anything short of that should focus on rehabilitation. Maybe even murder sometimes because there's plenty of cases where I don't think the murderer really deserved their sentence.

Gypsy Rose Blanchard for example didn't deserve 10 years in prison IMO. Certainly not in low quality conditions."
"The vast majority of incarcerated people fall into the ""remediable"" category and this idea that we need to treat all of them based on how we'd like to treat the worst monsters is ridiculous."
"This. Please tell me how someone who murders, rapes, or traffics in human beings deserves to live in a ‚Äújail‚Äù like this?"
"For what it‚Äôs worth, private prisons only house 8.4% of USA-wide prisoners. Your public prisons are quite honestly just as horrific, and have a lot of the same fucked up incentives."
Do you remember the name of the documentary? I'd like to learn more about that and see what else it has to show
"Yeah I saw that segment. I had already had my own opinions on lethal punishment before that segment (against it), but the pure horror of that segment still shook me."
"I‚Äôm pretty sure what happened there was a big scandal. And again, we‚Äôre talking about making people watch someone get tortured. Guantanamo is incredibly isolated from the US public purview.

Even when we found out we were torturing al quaeda members, it was considered reprehensible."
"The problem is that you would need to replace the firing squad after every execution, since it fucks up the executioners so much."
"It‚Äôs a complex issue and socio-economic factors which push people to crime definitely have an impact. See Nordic countries welfare states which help prevent poverty pushing people to crime. 

Also key is societal attitudes towards crime and punishment and the impact that has on sentencing. If you‚Äôre sending people to custodial settings for offences that aren‚Äôt violent or sexual in nature you create overcrowding and a lot of the unpleasant issues in US prisons."
Yet another reason why the system should be reformed in such a way that victimless crimes don't carry a prison sentence.
"Yup. The US has the highest incarceration rate (prisoners per 100 000 people) in the world.

Compared to some other major western countries: 


US: 655 per 100k

Australia: 167

England and Wales: 141

Spain: 126

Canada: 114

France: 102

Italy: 96

Germany: 78

"What staggered me is that crime records are required even for things like MC Donald's jobs. I did lots of internships in the summer and the only times I needed a crime record was when working for the government and for a bank, which makes sense since I handled sensitive data. 

But why the fuck does a MCD's employee need a clean criminal record? And why is it allowed to drug test employees? I mean I understand it for certain groups like pilots but a desk job? That's just ridiculous.

Americans like to rant and rave about their ""freedom"" but completely ignore aspects like this."
It becomes a criminal one when you commit other crimes besides drug abuse...
"Bear in mind that Kumla is a comparatively large prison, with various sections. Kumla has one of the ""Phoenix sections"", essentially a prison within the prison, also known as ""the bunker""."
"most people in jail arent rapists. most are non violent drug offenders, or people who made a dumb mistake of some variety, or people with mental health issues.

our prisons in america have a high rate of people returning to them, because we treat them like monsters."
Well usually you go to one or the other. Not both.
maybe not americans...

Fuck, even typing it sarcastically made me  a little angry"
Do you mean Brock **‚ÄùThe Rapist‚Äù** Turner?
"When those in the justice system admit that prison ruins the life of the convict, so we shouldn't send nice young RAPISTS to prison.."
This gets me so angry. Particularly when I also remember the Central Park 5 and what happened to Korey Wise.
"I don‚Äôt know about that. My aunt got 5 chances instead of 3 before prison. And she was committing fraud, drug/dealing, theft, etc. arrested 5 times and never went to jail for more than a night. Paid minimal fines until the fifth time when the fraud was against my grandpa and he charged her. Couldn‚Äôt get out of that one. She‚Äôs the definition of white trash, and her skin got her out of a lot."
"Money buys everything, including a hall pass on personal responsibility."
"Are there disparities in arrest rates of the Indian and Asian population in America compared to whites? I‚Äôm asking this genuinely, because if it‚Äôs not part of the problem I don‚Äôt see why they would mention all demographics of the US."
**BILLSMAFIA**
Yeah they had Russian prisons too! And some gypsy prisons which were pretty cool to see.
"It's not about what anybody deserves, or would you rather go back to ""eye for an eye""? If the person is not spending life in prison, they are going to go back into society at some point. If you treat them like garbage, make a point of punishing them, isolating them from the world and destroying any chance of them getting a job and a stable life, guess what they're going to do?

You have 2 options which make sense. Either a progressive, rehabilitative system, or life in prison/death penalty. Punishing people won't bring the people they killed back, nor will it undo the rapes they committed. It will only make them hurt more people."
"They should have said state, rather than private. State prisons are generally way worse off than federal, especially in the South. 

Whole system is still fucked top to bottom though"
"Sorry but no I don't, this was probably a little over a year or so ago that I had a slight obsession with prison documentaries and watched a ton of them. I want to say it was almost definitely on Netflix. I'll dig through my watch history and see if I can find it"
"I doubt any change will come soon, the US is so extremely corrupt. There's profit in keeping prisons full, and with money comes lobbying, bribes, power, etc."
Yea we need a degree to get ahead in society (yes I‚Äôm well aware of trades). And a lot of universities here MAKE you stay on campus at least your freshman year. That means being forced to pay inflated ass rent to live in a crappy dorm room.
"""Hey bro, Nice dick"""
As in the ones with a private bathroom you had to walk into the bathroom before you walked into the room... the communal ones the rooms just opened straight into the hallway.
Why talk with only one head when you can talk with two.
We would share it with 3 other people... also why bother cleaning my own bathroom when someone would for me
Lol you‚Äôre telling me. I just graduated somehow. Completely bullshitted my way through to a finance degree. But if you think that‚Äôs bad our primary schools are complete trash. Especially in the south where I‚Äôm from.

"And then that our pres took out a full page ad to call for the Central Park 5‚Äôs death? It‚Äôs infuriating, my dude."
Not everyone deserves a second chance. Not everyone can be rehabilitated. There are some people that just no longer need to be on this earth. It's bizarre to me that people can't comprehend this
You're being downvoted but you're absolutely right
"""Wanna dock while we talk?"""
Thanks I grew it myself
Yeah that's communal either way by my standards
Incredibly fucked up man.
Did you mean Brock the Rapist Turner? The one who raped a woman with his fingers while she was unconscious by a dumpster? That rapist?
Dayton has never been the most progressive area of the country.
IIRC it‚Äôs what his dad actually said in front of real people in a completely serious manner with no hint of sarcasm or irony. And IIRC he still considers himself a human instead of something lower than pond scum.
"iirc the term used (by the father of that animal) was ""action"" rather than ""fun."" Just as bad, of course."
And who do you think is qualified to make the decision of whether somebody lives or dies? Me? You? The government which will surely use this power maliciously sooner or later?
"Once again, that's not the point. If rehabilitation isn't possible what you suggest? Death penalty? Life sentence? 

What if you keep someone locked up for 25 years and all that time you treat him like an animal? Do you think he will be cool with it and won't seek revenge? You have to break the cycle. If you punish someone in that way, you'd better kill them because you just created a monster."
It was 4 people sharing 1 bathroom or 40 sharing something like 8...
thank you fo your service. this should be the response anytime a rapist is mentioned in conversation.
"I think they meant ""that piece of shit, waste of human flesh and rapist,"" Brock Turner."
There should be a bot for this
"What. The. Fuck.

So. Im gonna go kill the dad and his son real quick, its okay cause im white, Why ruin my life over 20 minutes of fun?

See how this shit can be applied? I mean... i would love to kill them but.. im not a WEALTHY white person with a brought future so ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Actually he was just aware enough to say ""20 minutes of action"", not ""fun"". 

Still a despicable PoS, and it doesn't really surprise me that the son of such a douchebag is a rapist who blamed his personal shortcomings on ""party culture"" and never even apologized."

No, it's not my dog. As the title states, it is our neighbor's who also has an Instagram for their good bois:

https://www.instagram.com/_tuck_and_finn_/?igshid=3p3whoit111k

The picture is not ""fake and gay"" or shopped, though obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion. 

This is in the US (midwest) and it seems to be an Imperial moth from people far more educated in the insect world than I am.  

I honestly, simply wanted to share a beautiful picture of a beautiful moment.  I had NO clue this would blow up like it did -- I'm a reddit novice."

But my father would see that I was scared and would turn out the light, saying, ""Turn out the light, the moth will go out."" Keep that in mind, /u/Namika.    :)"
"Well good news, these are really mellow. They don't eat, unlike many other moths, so they like to conserve energy for reproduction, especially females (like this one). You could pretty much hold one in your hand for several minutes. That would be why it stayed still on the dog. But they may vibrate their wings a lot while they're stationary."

"There‚Äôs this documentary called Dominion. One of the scenes was of a couple of Australian hunters hunting this same breed of pig. I guess they found the mother, dogs ganged up on her while the hunter slit her throat. They got the screaming baby and let him/her loose crying away into the bushes....soul crushing. 

Anyway this helps, nice to see animals be happy."

"It's SO funny because I read the title and thought (for some dumb reason) it was going to be a picture of the Warthog in mud or something. I watched Lion King as a kid and for some reason I thought the animal was a Wart-Hog and I always pronounced the vehicle as Warth-og. So not seeing the space between wart and hog made me think of the vehicle. I hope my post made sense. 

TL;DR - blonde moment and wasn't expecting cute animal but instead the finest vehicle known to man and excels in vehicular combat(poor handling tho)."

And all shooting some droids outside of the Jedi school
When a couple of sith who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, ""You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Tatooine‚Äù

I begged and pleaded with her day after day
But she packed my space ship and sent me on my way
She gave me a kiss and then she gave me my cloak

"My college roommate and I were drunk one night on the way home from a pizza shop and got in a big shouting fight about some stupid drama, we both liked this girl Anna and both thought she liked us, on the sidewalk in the city. We weren‚Äôt about to hurt eachother but were yelling at eachother like we might I guess, and were extremely heated. These two cops come up out of nowhere and one unholsters his gun and the other yells ‚Äúwhat the hell is going on here!‚Äù 

Our little bro fight which hadn‚Äôt even come to any physical contact (which at worst would‚Äôve been a little wrestling, I would never, even drunk, strike that kid, he was tiny and I loved him like a brother) suddenly had a gun involved. We were behaving inappropriately for a public street for sure, but at the end of the day the worst thing that would‚Äôve happened with no police was me putting my buddy in headlock till he said ‚Äúwe‚Äôre cool, we‚Äôre cool‚Äù. Because the police were there, there was now a deadly weapon aimed at us. We were immediately like ‚Äúnothing sir we were just messing around I‚Äôm sorry! We‚Äôre sorry!‚Äù and he finally said ‚Äúwell get out of here!‚Äù

We weren‚Äôt blameless for sure, we were idiots. But that was the opposite of deescalation. That was sudden and severe and dangerous escalation. And we were two white college kids. 

Even if a situations not serious, cops can make it serious very quickly."

"The closest thing I could think of was from attraction‚ÄùHoney I shrunk the audience‚Äù, where one scene they turn off the lights in the theater and you hear screaming from the front rows, that progresses to the back of the theater.

"it looks like the windows in the back were shut way more than in the front, I started thinking that halfway through as well. If someone was yelling from the front of the train by the time people figured out what the hell they were talking about they would be getting douched with water.

Best I could come up with is maybe someone at the front of the train called someone at the back.

"It didn't choose an angle; someone did this on purpose (likely the cameraman). The water is pouring out of the far side of a [flange (a pipe connector held together by studs and nuts with a gasket in the middle to keep liquid inside)](https://blog.projectmaterials.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/flanged-joint.jpg). You get this kind of spray when you loosen studs on one side only. We sometimes do this to drain remaining product from the line when doing maintenance except always on the bottom studs to have any product either avoid you or spill onto your legs - never toward yourself, your face, or others.

Obviously the line is still live so all the pressure is going out the loose side which was intentionally directed toward the train."

Just mimicking what usually happens in Indian soap operas.
"When you start recording in portrait, a script should pop up (covering what‚Äôs being recorded) & it should ask ‚Äúare you sure you don‚Äôt want to record in landscape?‚Äù & when the person presses ‚Äúyes‚Äù it turns off the recording."

"Missionaries stepped up their game, baptisms by the train load."
Uk here: if that train was in my station I could walk along it and alight at the next village.
"No one did this on purpose, this is pretty common in Indian railway stations, these pipes are always leaking water. This happens mostly due to poor maintenance."
Classic cameramen
Couldn't something have hit the pipe and bolts in just the right fashion thus loosening them? Genuinely curious if there's a chance this could be accidental.
That is a gross misuse of a diesel fuel pipeline.

When I was a young boy my parents took me to Disney. When the thing started smacking my ankles I reached down and grabbed hold of the tube and turned to my mom and said ‚ÄúHey Ma! Look I caught the mouse!‚Äù

1980‚Äôs and early 1990‚Äôs EPCOT was awesome. Such a shame Disney has ignored this park for so long.
"I‚Äôve always wished for a ‚ÄúYesterday Land‚Äù. A place where old rides are moved to. And maybe a few rides that were refurbished. 

No way would it ever make financial sense since Disney does reuse old animatronics and props. For example, old animatronics from America Sings were used in Splash Mountain. And some even stripped of their skin were put in Star Tours. 

But it would be nice for an official high def / 4K video with clear audio for archival purposes. 

Best thing I have is YT for some official former videos like Star Tours.

So no one has showers.
On one hand India is having water crisis and on the other hand gallons of water is being wasted like it‚Äôs nothing.
In most European trains it's also second class
"There is several classes on Indian trains.   Second class is more of an economical way to travel intercity.

Unreserved seating is where the real fun is, 25 cents to take a train halfway across a province and you dont even need to sit because the train is so packed you literally can't move.  It is insane, it feels like being digested.  You just stand there and vague shifts in the crowd pull you further into the compartment whether you want to go or not."
"Its probably the British who started the naming convention, Indians didn't bother to change it."

"They clearly forgot about all the jump cuts, slowmo shots and freeze frames, then."
The question is what's *not* floating in there
And then they say that they have a water shortage in India
I expect nothing less from a vertical filmer
"No that's not how they work. At least 3-4 studs have to be loose for this to happen. For an accident to have caused that would mean a train hit it at *just* that right angle and sped to bend the one side of the flange enough to leak. That would be a catastrophic event for pipe like this. If anything hit it, the pipe would give way far sooner than the flange.

With that said, gaskets can leak but our standards for a leak are under 1000*ppm*. You'd never see this in a non third world country because it's be fixed before it could happen.

In my experience in the first world, this can't happen accidentally."
It‚Äôs like raaaaain directly in your faaace
"Wow this just unblocked a childhood memory I think. Can't watch now but was there a part where there was rats in the movie, and they release these things that felt like rat tails that would whip your ankles like a bunch of rats were running by your feet?

If I'm thinking of the right thing, this absolutely traumatized me as a young kid, I sat with my feet up on the chair for the remainder of the show."
I think the same effect was used on the universal backlot tour when the bus goes through The Mummy scene. Wasn't it also used during The Bugs Life experience at California Adventures?
"Hooter was such an unqualified ditz. Cute, but still"
"It's weird that Disney doesn't seem to be able to create new magic in the Magic Kingdom.  I think perhaps people are really most interested in reliving their childhood, which is precisely why I go and can sit through Haunted Mansion and Pirates of the Caribbean multiples times and never get tired of it.  Oh, and Carousel of Progress is the best Summer time best the heat activity in the park.  It brings back so many memories too."

You can get a similar experince on the first off peak train services out of London in the evening.
I have to say this was written rather well
"Not entirely unlike Sydney trains at peak time, then."
"Like others have said, that was entertainingly well-written."
"We have though, current nomenclature is 'Standard Class' here in the UK."
"My dad's brother passed and I accompanied him to the other side of the country by train. He can't fly, and a long drive without sure access to a bathroom at his age isn't good. He wouldn't have been able to do the trip in his condition without me, so it meant a lot to him, he kept thanking me. I was just excited to be on a train and spend time with my dad.

So, we went from Seattle down to Sacramento on the Coast Starlight, from Sacramento to Chicago on the California Zephyr, and Chicago to Albany on the Lake Shore Limited. 

Nearly 100 hour trip. Then we did it all over again on the way back. 

We had sleepers, no other choice for him, so it wasn't awful, and honestly it was the best sleep I've had in ages. I actually really enjoyed it."

"I haven‚Äôt gone on the backlot tour. Need to get over to universal more (last time I went, HP land just opened). 

And I have never been to Disneyland. The bugs life at AK Disney World has a stinger that pokes your back and bugs that crawl under your butt. But I don‚Äôt remember a tube / air effect between your legs."
"IIRC, all three of those rides had Walt‚Äôs input / approval. But Carousel needs an update for the ‚Äúmodern‚Äù scene. 

I think the old rides have nostalgia, so they are loved even though they aren‚Äôt using cutting edge tech. But it‚Äôs also partly survival bias. There are plenty of rides at MK that were there in the 70‚Äôs that have been removed. And a few newer ones that are pretty well loved. 

For example, Flight to the Moon / Mission to Mars was pretty boring. Alien encounter was way better, just didn‚Äôt seem to fit the MK target market. Stitch was a way to tone it down, but it was like selling diapers to teenagers. Too scary for little kids. Too silly for tweens / teens. 

Also, Splash Mountain was opened in 1992 and Thunder Mountain was in 1980. Both staples of the MK. 

Buzz Lightyear Space ranger spin is a lot more fun than ‚Äúif you have wings‚Äù and ‚Äútake flight‚Äù. New fantasy land is better than 20,000 leagues. And Tron (opening 2020/2021) looks awesome

But I‚Äôd agree. You have to go on Jungle Cruise, Pirates, Haunted Mansion, Peter Pan, Small World, and Carousel of Progress. But I bet Ariel and Winnie the Pooh will be up there soon."

"Originally they did actually have second class, until the Railway Regulation Act 1844 which required third class be regularly provided (with minimum standards not significantly below what was being offered in second class and a free luggage allowance of 56 lbs) with the benefit that duty would not be charged on third class passengers. Naturally, the railway companies were aware that most second class passengers would downgrade to third, so their own class was scrapped."
That's because in the US we're all just temporarily embarrassed millionaires.
This is my hole.
"Brownian motion implies that there is space to move around. 
 
There isn't."
"Possibly, I didnt take them often as it was more a form of local transport.

However India was weird.  Anyone involved with the tourism industry or that approached us first we learned to treat with extreme suspicion.  I remember we had one businessman sit down at a bench next to us and start reading the paper.  He asked us a question about the trains and then we got into a conversation with him and an hour later he turned out to be a tout trying to sell us a hotel room.  It sounds unbelievable until you are there but the culture of scamming tourists is prevalent and it can happen in subtle ways.  So you were more likely to be robbed in 2 or 3 AC which is the class most tourists elected to ride. 

However we learned that the vast majority of Indians were great people and if we approached a local at random they were polite and extremely helpful.  So while you could be unlucky to be crushed into a train with a bastard in low class.  Most times I think it was actually safer.  I remember one time a father and daughter gave us their seat and absolutely insisted we sit down there in the packed train because of our packs.  Another time we were attacked by a roaming cow and everyone within 20 meters jumped in to save us.  And another time when my girlfriend got fed up with a persistent tout and started screaming at him about 15 people jumped in and forcibly removed him.

India was such a mix, it was easy to hate the people when you dealt with people in the tourism business for too long but the regular people taking the unreserved seating were usually just normal and generous people."
"We're lazier. 
We struck down the law criminalising homosexuality just last year or so."
Sleeping on a train is underrated. It's like being rocked to sleep by a white noise machine. The rhythmic clicking of the wheels is purely hypnotic to me.
Took a sleeper on a slow train in Thailand goin down to the islands. Truly some of the best sleep of my life.
"Jeez, that was an expensive trip. Sleepers the whole way on a three leg Amtrak round trip journey?"
"You can walk around on the train easily tho, and those seats are enormous.

But yeah, trains in the US are more about the journey instead of the destination."
"I dont know how it works in the US, but in most of the world you get to sleep in a comfy bed during such long journeys. It's not that bad actually.

I took an overnight sleeping train in Russia and arrived the next morning completely refreshed. It was much better than flying."
"That was one of the most hilarious videos I've seen in like a month.  It's not even really that fantastic story...it's all in how infectious his laughter is.

That turns his laugh from infectious to ominous!

Nope. All train lines in India are electrified so if someone sits on the roof he's likely to get roasted or become flash.

"Yeah, my only problem was not sleeping the first night due to wildfires forcing us off and onto a bus from Klamath Falls, Oregon, to the rest of the way down to Sacramento... 

Started for bed and then they was like ""Nah, you ain't sleeping here! Get in the bus!"" Couldn't sleep at all on the bus, and it took foreeevvveeer. 

But sleeping on the train was amazing. Basically a gym mat for a mattress, shitty blanket, but slept so good. I just dropped money I don't really have on a nice bed and I'm still not sleeping like I did on those trains."
"You shouldn‚Äôt really get too much clicking on a modern train - the traditional ‚Äòclickety-clack‚Äô associated with trains is due to old jointed track, while modern welded track is fairly silent. Idk about America, but here in the UK only a few branch lines and sidings use jointed track (because several major accidents have been caused by it in the past)."
"Can confirm, never had a bad sleep on a train"
"It has to be - even driving the route is faster (Chicago->San fran via Grand Junction is about 35hrs).

Which makes sense given that the Zephyr averages about 55mph while most people cruise down the highways going 85ish"

"How do you do the kudu that you do, so well?"

"Kudu are pretty cool creatures - I learned a lot about them in South Africa. 

They have incredible vertical jumping power, so much so that they're a giant pain in the ass for natural reserves and private safari farms that use baited enclosure traps for tracking and inoculation, because they simply jump the fences and eat the bait without triggering the mechanisms.

Also they apparently live right on the edge of classifications. Anything larger than a Kudu will be classified as a Bull and Cow, eg. A male Eland is a Bull and a female Giraffe is a Cow. Anything smaller than a Kudu is a Buck and a Ewe, eg. A male Impala is a Buck and a female Springbok is a Ewe, all good stuff. But since the female Kudu is smaller than the male, it has resulted in the male Kudu being classified a Bull, and the smaller female a Ewe. Does it mean anything significant? No, but it's a fun fact. 

Oh and their meat is very delicious and can be prepared in a million different ways."

"A safari park ranger once taught me that each full twist of a kudus antler signifies two years of life, and when after a double twist it reaches the white tip - that's 5+ years. So this supermodel has been around for a bit!"
That antelope looks like his name is Sven
This antelope is prettier than me and my girlfriend

Is there a subreddit for supermodel animals?

Guys that look like this have a %150 chance of stealing your doe.
"Ernest Hemingway writes about hunting these in his book, *The green hills of Africa*.  In my head they were never this magnificent."
"I was on safari two years ago and a large male kudu walked within arms reach of our car. We were about 10 yards from the edge of a mostly dry river sitting in the shade of a small patch of jungle. Lions were crossing the other side of the river. Seeing the kudu watch the lions, standing alert with his back to us and his large statuesque horns framed in an opening of trees overlooking the river, is one of the most remarkable moments of my life. Maybe the most majestic animal I‚Äôve ever witnessed in person."
"i did take drugs yesterday, but does that antelope have a weirdly human face?"
"That's blue steel, the look only certain models make!"
Why is this kudu more attractive than I‚Äôll ever be?
"Breathtaking beauty and intelligence and athletic power captured here.  A fully realized apex example of its species.  

""Supermodel"" is an inadequate descriptor."
Stupid sexy Íµ¨Îëê
Looks too real to be a model.

"Actually, right now I'm in Namibia, one of the countries where this magnificent antelope lives. And, by several test I can state that not only do they look amazing, but they taste pretty good as well üòãüòä"
Damn that critter is majestic AF. It should be a character in one of the chronicles of Narnia movies.

In zootopia the supermodel was an antelope named Gisele. This picture might have inspired that decision.

See, most zoo's logos feature more well-known animals like pandas or elephants or cheetahs etc. But not Saint Louis Zoo. The Saint Louis Zoo's logo is a kudu! Not only does this post prove they are majestic af, but picking a lesser-known animal sparks curiosity, which in turn leads to learning! Good on ya, Saint Louis Zoo!"

This will be reposted in a few weeks
"Whatever photoshop filter was used to make this thing look more ""silvery"", detracts from the original photo. This one looks more like a painting almost. The source photo looks much nicer. This looks like someone tried to give it silver highlights."
There should be some rule about OP's crediting the images though. :/
I feel this is what my stand would look like
Literally any of those pictures could make the front page like this one did. Get ready for a bunch of greedy assholes to rip those source pics and post them.

"This may be because I just woke up, but looking at the gallery on that website made me kinda wish that humans had horns like that. Each one is slightly different and unique.

No the red in the ears is supposed to mimic the blood of his human victims that he wears with pride after he tortured and killed them slowly.
"Who is that meant to fool? Genuinely, this is the first time I‚Äôve heard of this. The most I could imagine is that the ears could make predators think they‚Äôre being watched and don‚Äôt have the surprise element, but wouldn‚Äôt just being a large animal in general (something that can be seen without the eyes) be enough? Not to mention horns.

Do you have a source for that theory?"

I just visited San Diego Zoo and saw the Lesser Kudu. What is the difference? Also saw the Southern Gerenuk next to it. Was some of our groups favorite animals!
can you ELI5 why their horns grow in a spiral?
Wow. All these other antelope are just trying to knock each other out but the gemsbock looks like it's ready for murder.
"someone posted an original version of the image. Someone punched up the contrast and sharpness pretty significantly, hence the drop in res. but it's still a gorgeous photo."
Are you experiencing an existential crisis?
How can it be real when our eyes aren't even real?
"Damn man no offense but if this triggers your ""wtf thats not a real animal"" you need to get out more lol XD its like a pretty looking gazelle but doesn't look unworldly.

"Such a shame the way this picture is being exploited.

All the antelope did was be really really, really really good looking."
And sharpened to 11
Apparently the kind of clown that knows how to get an image upvoted to the very top on a site with hundreds of millions of users.
Not to mention really badly sharpened.
It‚Äôs not over saturated. The sharpening and clarity were pushed way up.

"Sorry, I am not familiar with the image processing terminology. I wouldn't have guessed that the term ""high pass"" is generally known there, since the concept of  the two-dim frequencies of an image is not quite popular."

"Problem with this one is someone specifically edited out a watermark to make it look like their own picture, presumably. When the actual photographer depends on getting that watermark seen for his/her livelihood, it takes a real piece of shit to remove it for fake internet points."

Favourite Strepsirrhini: Pygmy Slow Loris

new world monkey: Owl Monkey (simply because they are nocturnal which is a neat adaptation)

Cetaceans: Right Whale

Marsupial: Thylacine (RIP)

Are you implying that coconuts migrate?
"Neither look like they‚Äôre approximating a human. The top just looks like an antelope and yours looks like a monkey or lemur (or Rafiki). It‚Äôs not uncanny valley if you think it looks a bit human and also looks creepy. Uncanny valley is when it almost looks perfectly human but it‚Äôs a little bit off, and that small often unintentional difference makes it very unsettling to look at."
I cannot associate any of those names with images. Just goes to show how little I know about the world we inhabit.
Really? The pygmy slow loris over the golden angwantibo? We're no longer friends.

Anytime I go to a boba tea (Quicklys) in Milpitas I always get me a pandan waffle. Shit is tits good. I actually bought me some pandan seeds to see if I am able to recreate the fragrance. I‚Äôve read it‚Äôs the Asian equivalent of vanilla. And the grass it‚Äôs made from looks pretty neat too.
"They sell these at a lot of Vietnamese bakeries in the states as well. They also have Taro bread, which is just as good!"
Ah yes. Pandan bread. One of my childhood favourites. ( Greetings from Singapore! )

 [https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/buko-pandan-salad/](https://www.kawalingpinoy.com/buko-pandan-salad/)"
Had a coworker bring back coconut pandan candies from Vietnam! I had never heard of it before and now I'm going through one of those times where it starts popping up in references everywhere
Does this occur in indonesia aswell? I have indonesian family members who occasionally make exactly this type of cake.
What's it taste like?
Toast with a non-toast color just looks like a sponge.
It looks like [you can buy the dried leaves off Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00THOM620/ref=cm_sw_r_sms_apa_i_JsCkDbW2MGPVJ). I like the name they're given with the listing... Pandanus üòÇ
Mmm... Hulk bread
Also here in the Philippines we add them in drinks called buko pandan buko in english is coconut
Pandan is my favorite flavor!!!! It tastes like a mild combination of coconut and vanilla. It's delicious. They have all kinds of pandan snacks at the world market near my house.
My local Baker in Australia make Pandan Cakes.  Never tried one. Lived here for nearly 15 years.
Soylent Green is people!
"This is my everyday snack in Indonesia. If I had known that taking a pic of my regular food and posting it to reddit would gain me this much karma I would have done it years ago.


I am a little bit mindblown that you guys found this interesting though. Like, damn I see it everyday"
"Doesn't most of South East Asia have Pandan flavoured stuff? I love it, together with all the Rose flavoured stuff.

What's this specific snack called? (Apologies if I didn't scroll down far enough)"
"Got a pandan cake from china town, bit like a swiss roll with cream and no jam, bought it thinking it was matcha but it was very nice, not too powerful of a flavour."
Imagine buying a green sponge just to make a joke about green bread
Pandan = screwpine leaves
That bread reminds me of a pistachio muffin. I'm sure pandan tastes nothing like it but I am craving it now because my brain is telling me it will.
Give colour to toast or its real
Is this a thing in Southeast Asia? The Philippines has it too!
"Presumably you also have green slices of bread, or do you only eat this toasted?

Is the fragrance improved by toasting?

I'm more curious about this than I should be."
Jean Claude Pandan
"As a Malaysian, I was kinda surprised and pleased to see something Malaysian on the popular page but of all things, it's bread?? üòÇ"
"USA here, just made a pandan cake the other day! I absolutely love the flavor"
Pandan bread is the shit!!
"Born and lived in Malaysia for almost 30 years, never saw one of these. Where did you get it?"
[That's a nice-looking plant.](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Pandan_Leaf_%28Pandanus_amaryllifolius%29_1.jpg/220px-Pandan_Leaf_%28Pandanus_amaryllifolius%29_1.jpg)
There is a tiny deli in an area near me that is densely populated with Vietnamese people and they do a coconut and pandan bubble tea.  It's fucking amazing and I've never seen it offered outside of that specific place. It's so good that it's not even worth getting a typical bubble tea from anywhere else in the city.
If I ever hatch a shiny Azurill I'm naming it Pandan.
"Intriguing, would love to try one day. Just read that it is considered the vanilla of Asia."
Dr. Seuss would approve
"OP, I live near Atlanta in the U.S. and can get some panda items like bread and cupcakes here. Check out the menu at this plaxe I frequent. https://www.sweethutbakery.com/sweet-menu"
Found the toast for my green eggs and ham
shrek bread
It looks amazing. Could you possibly describe the taste?
I love pandan!
I love pandan deserts!
Pandan sweets are delicious
Pandan is legit one of the best subtle flavors for things that I love.
Pandan is my favourite flavour of anything ever.
"We have this too, just leave regular bread in the cupboard for a few weeks"
Pandan cake is undefeated
What does oandan taste like? Is it akin to matcha?
We just call it moldy bread here
"I just got back from a trip to Malaysia. Absolutely love your country. The scenery, food, wildlife, and most of all the people were all amazing."
Gracie‚Äôs ice cream in Somerville‚Äôs (ma) union Sq has pandan flavour ice cream every so often.
Is green dye added to make it that shade of green?
"No Sam I am, I would not like green toast and ham"
That color does not look natural in any way
We have rainbow bread here in Canada. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs just food dye but yeah
Another word is artificial color üòÇ
Staple it to a tree.
Staple it to a tree
"We already had green eggs and ham, it's about time we get the toast too!"
I'm sure I'm not the first one to say weed bread
Where is Dr suess?! This would go great with green eggs and ham.
Looks like that abrasive side SpongeBob once had.
"Anyone who lives in Vancouver,  BC and wants an accessible way to try Pandan flavor, Crackle Creme in Chinatown has it in one of their creme brulees. It's awesome."
I get this with old bread I leave out for 2 months.  It's not that tasty
That‚Äôs the back of a sponge
My coworker makes her cake out of this leaf. IT IS SO DAMN GOOD. SO MOIST. It's a 2 layer cake with fresh fruit on the middle and top. It was really good. PLEASE TRY IT IF YOU HAVE THE CHANCE.
Add some poppy seeds to the dough and make the crust nice and fuzzy and you got yourself some kiwibread
r/breadstapledtotrees you guys are up
We have something that looks like this here in Canada called pistachio bread ( or ninja turtle bread). Basically pound cake with pistachio pudding in it. It‚Äôs awesome.
Now staple it on a tree
Kaya spread is delicious.
We have that in Singapore except it‚Äôs a cake
lol Pandan sounds like a Pokemon
"In the US we throw bread out when it turns green. 

But that takes like six months because of all the chemical preservatives in out ""bread"""
Perfect side to round out green eggs and ham for a complete green breakfast!
"holy carp without reading the description i'd have thought it's a cleaning sponge.

&#x200B;

is it actually naturally that green?"
Can you describe the taste?
We have these down here in Australia. We call them kitchen sponges.
But pandan alone wouldn't give so rich a green
Looks like square kiwi
But do you staple it to trees? This bread belongs on a tree.
bread dipped in dishwashing liquid
"So you have green toast that you infuse with Pandan?

How did it get the green color then?"
Why isn't this a thing all over the world?
Where do they sell those? Which brand is it from? I'm Malaysian and I've never seen this bread sold in the supermarket before.
Looks like a scrubbing sponge to me....
SPONGE
"shrek toast

&#x200B;

shrek toast"
That green has to have some dye in it!
In Detroit we have that too.. but it happens naturally.. over time..
In England this would be called ‚Äúgone off‚Äù
Why are the edges of your sponge brown?
We call this mold in America
Of course the real question is:  How does it taste with avocado?
Have you seen r/breadstapledtotrees please staple some pandan and link me
That'll go great with my green eggs and ham.
Would go well with green eggs and ham
It looks like something from St. Patrick's day.
Is it not green bread before it‚Äôs green toast? Or this bread turns green when you toast it? ü§£
"""Oh, sorry, you wanted Pandan in your bread? I guess I thought it weird to put meat in bread."""
It looks like an oddly shaped sponge
"And now I have a new quest, I must have this."
With friends like these
"Some Asian drink places instead of using I guess toast,
They usually make it into a waffle shape"
"Pandan :D

I'm not from malaysia btw"
Holy shit my friend would bring this to school and I‚Äôd beg for it coz it‚Äôs so good!
Hmm pandan :)
"I genuinely thought that was a sponge, before I read the title"
There is definitely a fair amount of green food coloring in there as well
"I love pandan, I have an employee that brings in treats from her budist temple and im always excited for what I call panda treats üòÅ"
Sponge?
almost anything made with pandan is good.
I love pandan!!
I love eating these bread
Looking at this now im craving for kuih bakar
Is... is that SpongeBob's abrasive side?
It looks like some other kind of leaf to me
So... What does it taste like? (For those of us who haven't tried.)
i can smell the pandan
So that's why they're going extinct
"Ube in the Philippines is weird, its used similarly but its bright purple."
I learned that cockraches hate the smell of pandan. That's why my mom put pandan leaves on cupboards and cook rice with it to give rice an aroma.
Or just a simple way to sell rotten breads (im jk üòÇ) it actually looks really delicious
"edit:  
Bread"
I thought this was a sponge!
Damn makes me crave for coffee and pandan bread man
Could i have some eggs and ham on my green toast please?
That sounds amazing!  Can you get in the states?
Looks like a cleaning sponge
How does your shit look after digestin this?
Pandas taste so good! That bread must be amazing.
They also have toast like this in chernobyl.
"Not only Malaysian have this, but also the Philippines."
Get it stapled!
Who else thought this was a cleaning sponge when they first looked at it?
Looks like bread.
"Dude I lived in Malaysia and I have never seen that before üòÇ

But I believe that is something possible with pandan"
"Ah, yes, pandan bread or pandan cake. Could replace a birthday cake anywhere."
"Oh man I remember when I first moved to Singapore, and was horrified by bright green bread.

Now I love all the Pandan things.."
"Sir, that‚Äôs a sponge."
Nah dude those are just kitchen sponges
What brand?
What brand?
That toast looks like a pissed off David Banner loaf.
As a kid I remember getting rainbow colored white bread in the Philippines that looked like this.
"Pandan leave chicken. Delicious!

Edit: not changing it now because of the top reply but yes leaf, not leave."
Philippines too
pandan leave into the rice cooker is best. i have a pandan plant i keep in the USA so i have access to fresh leaves whenever i want
"We have pandan in the US as well, we have pandan bread, pandan mochi, pandan cake, pandan in foods. It is quite literally becoming a Pandamic in the US"
I ate pandan everything while I was in Thailand this past winter. It‚Äôs so delicious. The pandan rice gummy‚Äôs are so good
"I only know pandan rice (aka. fragrant rice?), which, I reckon, is cultivated in paddy fields where they also grow pandan plants, but just that mere hint of additional flavor is absolutely delicious. Boiling that rice with a stalk of lemon grass instantly transfers me back to SE Asia, even if it's minus 10 outside and snowing."
This is also in the Philippines
I used to get pandan gelato from a Thai restaurant near my University. It was so freaking good!
"So take some leaves and make a powder ""flour"" of them and ship that in an airtight container to those not local that might want to try it with a few recipes to try."
Wuddup! Philippines up in this bitch too!
The tea is amazing. Pandan is awesome.
I know. They need to sell them  here in US. I was born and raised in Thailand for 10 years and moved to the US. I miss eating pandan custard with steamed bread the most.
Also purple taro bread (which used to be my favorite).
Yeah I missed it. Do you know if it is possible to get it in Europe?
Pandan soy milk üëåüëåüëåüëåüëå‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
"I see the bread cake looking at my local Bahn mi place. What are they like, is it sweet or like an herby bread?"
"First time I've seen Thailand represented on reddit, our time to shine"
pandan infused soy milk is so much better than normal cow milk!!
Indonesian are also obsessed with pandan leaf. infuse it with water! trust me it‚Äôs amazing.
We have this in Australia too and it's called a green sponge sawed in half.
No wonder pandas are endangered.
Well u know how Malaysian is. Claiming everything as theirs.
"In Thai it is called ""Toey"", which is also my thai wife's name ^^"
I read it as ‚Äúpanda infused‚Äù and was very concerned for a moment.
"Pandan wafers are so tasty,!"
Vietnam too
Originally from SEA and its always a treat when my Ma can make pandan desserts here in Italy
"I had a pandan ice cream sandwich in Singapore. And when I mean ice cream sandwich, I mean the street vendor sawed a rectangular piece of ice cream off a big block and out it on a piece of folded pandan bread. It was delicious

Edit: [found a picture of it](https://i.imgur.com/RJWDdN3.jpg)"
Fellow SE Asian from the Philippines says kamusta
"I love pandan.  My god.  The smell of it makes me feel like I‚Äôm in another world.  

I love it so much I bought some pandan flavored extract.  I don‚Äôt know what to do with it.  Do you know of any recipes for it?"
"In the Netherlands they have a interesting variant. Pandan flavoured cake that used to be Portuguese in origin, and somehow ended up in the Netherlands:

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/74/Spekkoek.jpg

(You can buy it in 'toko's's (yes, we loaned that word from Malay), shops selling Asian food..)"
I was about to REEEE in Indonesian
"Didn't know the term ""pandan"" was used all over Southeast Asia! I thought it was just in our country!"
No matter where it's from.. it tastes frickin' amazing
"Edit: And Madagascar, Mauritius, Reunion, Seychelles."
"It taste like regular bread except with the fragrant of Pandan leaf.

Pandan taste kinda like vanilla, and we put it in our rice, bread spread to give it a nice aroma too.

The bread spread, Kaya is a mix of coconut milk, eggs and the Pandan leaf, many SEA countries have them as a staple.

As I'm writing this I'm eating pandan toast with pandan spread"
"Asian American chiming in. Pandan in my opinion is like a mixture of coconut and vanilla together. It‚Äôs delicious and beautifully fragrant. You can buy extract  from the asian store and easily put it into waffles, cupcakes, cakes, etc. please try it ! So good ü•∞


Edit: wording

Edit edit: use it exactly like lemon extract, vanilla extract, almond extract, etc. it‚Äôs literally the same thing! Please try it!"
"I would say pandan is primarily a dessert component, if that gives you a better idea."
"Pandan cake is like bread, but it tastes sweeter

Adding onto OP's description of Kaya, its like Jam but smoother But not as smooth as peanut butter, and its pretty sweet

Source: i live in singapore, we eat these pretty often"
It has the same aroma as Jasmine rice if you've had it. Just without the starchiness.
Pandan tastes like green Froot Loops.
Delete this or else I will bombard whatever country you live in with copious amounts of freedom
And Ireland wouldn't give a shit about it. St Patrick's day is odd.
Paddy's Pandan.
My first thought.
Actually most milk tea places serve waffles with this! They're extremely good and taste almost like coconut waffles.
"Never.

I will not eat them."
"Singaporean here,

If you eat eggs and ham for breakfast you are considered high class because we just go to the breadshop and buy some premade bread like pork floss or sausage buns"
"You can make green eggs by pouring red cabbage juice on them. The cabbage juice turns green in alkaline conditions. 

I don't think there's any nice way of making green ham."
Haram
"Those are mildly sweet, not good with eggs and ham. I prefer normal bread for eggs and ham. Or a full English breakfast."
"https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DJ8vebC2iBw/maxresdefault.jpg

Delicious"
I make pandan chiffon cake. It's quite stress inducing but worth it
Seconded.
I wany to inhale pandan chiffon cake because it is seriously that good
Its just surprise penicillin
It turns white probably
"the green of moulds are actually quite darker, easily spotted. and you always be able to tell the difference in their smell. the fresh one and the one that's going to expire are so distinct."
Same way you tell when blue cheese is moldy or sour cream has gone bad.
/r/mouldlyinteresting
"Don't smell it. I watched that documentary about the man without a face (head only has a mouth, like a crescent moon profile). Turned out bread mold grew in his nasal cavity and they had to scoop it all out to save his life. Do not smell moldy bread."
"Pandan Ice cream is defs a thing, I'm in Australia and you can get it from gelato messina (a relatively popular chain)"
"hahaha, if you think that would be good in ice cream let me introduce you to paddle pop"
Ah I see youre a man of culture as well.
"Came here to say just that my friend, here's your upvote"
Ohh buko pandan
Came for the Filipino reference. Such good stuff.
As demonstrated in this video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdDfF4hXfj4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdDfF4hXfj4)
Then we dry our dishes using a keffiyah.
"If you're cooking with it, I'd recommend Pandan paste. I've got the most flavor and fragrance from the paste when I'm baking with it."
The Vietnamese mall (pacific?) in the east side has a little place that makes great waffles too!
"Yeah, I grew up eating these in Houston, which admittedly has a huge Vietnamese population, but I was quite surprised this reached the top of this sub. It's such a natural food to me. If you're in Houston you can easily find this bread in Six Ping Bakery (and maybe 85¬∞ Bakery, but not too sure)

My local Vietnamese/Chinese grocer also sells a waffle powder mix, so that you can make pandan waffles, too"
">Taro bread

purple bread? taste good?"
Taro bread?!  TIL I'm going on the hunt for a Vietnamese bakery.
It's everywhere in Indonesia.
Yep absolutely! My dad's side of the family is Indonesian and my grandma makes suuch delicious pandan cake
I‚Äôve said in a few comments if you wanna check it out but IMO it‚Äôs very reminiscent of coconut and vanilla mixed together ! Very fragrant too.
Mild vanilla like
The same but it smells like pandan.
"It's better than normal bread that's for sure, but yeah mild vanilla with the fragant smell, like vanilla?"
*Pandanus amaryllifolius* is just the scientific name of the plant....
Pand anus hehe
"I don't think the dried stuff is as fragrant as the fresh stuff. But when it's your only option, you have to make do."
Buko pandan can also be a dessert too. Jist lose the amount of liquid and increase the gelatin count.
It's yum. If you like sweet things I would recommend it.
Ooo where? I've only had pandan once when a lady in our office made delicious little jelly things with it and it was amazing. I've been hanging for those ever since.
"We also have normal white bread etcs

I'll say toasting will improve aroma, but I usually eat it untoasted, just my preference"
"Well, bread *is* mildly interesting. We do have far more interesting things too!...Like a plane going missing. (*proceeds to cry in Manglish*)"
"No. It has a fragrant smell. People say it smells like vanilla, but it really doesn't. To me it has its own smell that's just really wonderful. It's an interesting ingredient because you can use it in both savory and sweet dishes."
Pandan only grows in SE Asia.
Usually bun je kan? I've seen a whole loaf like this too
Happy Cake Day!
"In the Netherlands this would be called ""Space Cake""."
Try boiling barley drink with this. Absolutely fragrant.
About 25 people in this thread have said it tastes like vanilla.
"Heads up, it's leaf for one, leaves for several, and leave for when you going somewhere else."
"(SEAan here) my mom used to make that ALL the time when I was a kid, I'll never get sick of it. It's delicious as hell!! I need some #soon whenever she manages to visit me"

Nothing beats buko pandan after a nice meal
"Yup, buko pandan, pandan puto, pandan custard cake, and so on....."
Buko pandan was always described to me as young coconut? Is it actually not?
What does it taste like?
"Add coconut milk into that rice and I think it turns into nasi lemak, a local delicacy."
Can't believe I've not heard of something that's apparently a pandemic already.
Dont you just throw a leaf in with the rice when cooking it?
You can find them easily in the US and Canada. Try any Asian market. Or even Amazon has pandan leaves in sealed bags you can buy.
They eat so much bamboo that their meat turns green and fragrant
Pandan pancakes are my favourite. Always used to make them in indo class at school. Made them at home once though and was cleaning green pandan flavouring off the stove/walls/floor/fridge for weeks.
Buko pandan is a super special treat to me.
I had pandan ice cream a few weeks back. Holy shit that was tasty. So flavorful and unlike any flavors I‚Äôd ever had.
"Pandan custard is *wonderful*.

You can just pour it over doughnuts, pancakes, waffles, actual cake slices and pretty much anything that fits the bill.. even chopped fruit.

Also much easier than having to infuse with the batter/dough mixture."
Where do you get pandan leaves in Europe? What do they look like?
"That's so old school, glad that's still around in Singapore. Yeah eating with bread is one of the best way to go about. Else you can also opt for two thin sliced of wafer between the cut ice cream."
Fun!
susu = milk in Malay

"Dadar Gulung! Crepes with pandan and a coconut filling, I had it in Indonesia and now make it all the time at home"
You can add it to any cake recipe. There‚Äôs a vegan restaurant that serves Pandan cake and it‚Äôs amazing. I absolutely love the flavor.
My mom makes pandan and coconut waffles. Always so fragrant and delicious!
"The smell of pandan is my fav too! Is this an extract form in paste or liquid? You can make pandan cookies, chiffon cake, cucpakes and literally anything by just adding the extract. 

The best place to start is Pinterest. If you can find some dark palm sugar ( Gula Melaka ), this combo makes a huge difference too. They paired very well together."
"You can put it in rice if you want it to smell beautiful.

It's also really good when infused with syrup or with coconut base desserts.

Edit: GELATIN!!!! If you wanna make some gelatin based desserts, look up Buko Pandan which is basically mix of milk, cream, pandan-infused gelatin, and buko (young coconut meat). It's like coffee jelly but you use coconut and pandan as your main flavours."
Search for Pandan brown sugar or palm sugar cake on Google for recipes
"Well, you were in Malaysia, after the Portuguese: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch_Malacca"

What does it taste like?
"My dad is bringing me back some Kaya at the end of the month, I'm fucking psyched."
">As I'm writing this I'm eating pandan toast with pandan spread

Why you gotta flex on us?"
TIL Kaya has pandan in it. I was born in Malaysia for context.
That sounds soooo delicious!!! I wish I could try it !!!
"That sounds amazing, I‚Äôve never had anything like what you‚Äôre describing."
Everyone responding has me craving to try it! Thanks for sharing!
Ive never had to describe pandan to anyone before but that is strangely accurate. Nice
"Sweet, flaming Democracy!"
"Diaspora generally involves the people who leave developing a different culture than the people who stay, if anyone is able to stay. Doesn‚Äôt mean the descendants of the diaspora have to forget their origins entirely. Frankly we‚Äôre lucky that both the Irish and the descendants of Irish immigrants are doing well enough to have two separate robust St Patrick‚Äôs Day traditions."
"Shhh, the americans want an excuse to get drunk and call it culture"
"Yep, all we do is have some parades and that's about it"
Not even on a train? Or in the rain?
"Oh this is a play on the book ""Green Eggs and Ham"". Not a commentary on the food elements of this particular breakfast."
"Ya Kun‚Äôs eggs though.

Like it‚Äôs just normal soft boiled eggs, but they manage to get it so perfectly runny every time. Whenever I make them myself it‚Äôs always hit or miss. There are some days I‚Äôll just pay a few bucks for eggs because they just do it so damn well"
It‚Äôs a Dr. Suess reference I think
"I've never tried pandan, but sweet bread (cinnamon rolls, pancakes,  French toast/pain perdu, etc.) is lovely paired with the salty, smoky flavor of ham. 

But the comment was definitely referencing [Green Eggs and Ham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Eggs_and_Ham)."
Quite ethical

Flavour spots.
"There's a blue-grey-green mold that grows on bread and also the more green variety. The former might be a little bit harder to see at first glance.

Any biologists know what the difference between those molds is?"

Heck yeah
I thought pandan was coconut this whole time! Anyone reading this has to try buko pandan ice cream it's the best
Good lord. That‚Äôs both sad and hilarious. Love that guy‚Äôs sense of humour.
Thank you for this video. That guy is amazing and that bread is absurd.
Of course no one around the house likes to clean toilets! You are supposed to put gloves on!!!
That was great. Had me giggling like a little kid.
"If there's one near you, 85¬∞ Bakery definitely sells a taro choco bun. Quite delicious"
Its fking delicious indeed! I want some of it rn
"Pretty sure they're aware of that and merely laughing at the ""anus"" component of the Latin name."
"It's not toast until you toast it. Until then it's bread.

Either way, looks good. i will look for this."

Except for the Toronto Maple Leafs. And when one leafs through a pile of loose papers.
"Look at all those leaf on the trees! There's dried leave on the floor by there, do you want to pick it up? Uh gross, I'm leavesing."
"Heads up, it is you when you refer to another person, it is your when it is an object belonging to someone, and it is you're for when you're going somewhere else."
And Leafs when they play hockey in Toronto!
Heads ups that chicken was cheating on that pandan. It was good for the pandan to leave
Unless you're referring to the Toronto Maple Leafs.

Couldn't agree more.
"Buko and pandan are two different things, often used together. Buko is coconut; pandan is a fragrant leaf."
"its a light floral taste, kinda vanillay, floral sweetness"
You can buy pandam flavoring at jungle Jim‚Äôs. It tastes kind of buttery. I think that the vanilla comparison is accurate
"Honestly, they taste a lot like rice. It's kinda weird to add it to rice."
"I think the reason one commenter said it tastes like rice is because it has a light jasmine flavor, not unlike jasmine rice. I would describe it as sweet jasmine with a hint of coconut and vanilla"
nasi lemak requires the sambal and anchovies.
Yep.
You can buy the pandan bread at asian markets too.
I had a plant and accidentally killed it. Been looking everywhere for another that doesn't cost an arm and a leg
"There‚Äôs a coffee shop nearby that does pandan waffles, SO good! They balance sweet and savory beautifully.

"I'm not sure about the brown color ones, but throughout my whole life I only use green kaya"
"Depends. The original brown one has no pandan, just eggs and sugar.

The green one has pandan."
Me too now I live in America
"It's like vanilla but different enough that you want more immediately. Like herbal vanilla. 

You can find pandan extract in some Asian/Pac Islander stores. 

I mix it into sour cream, cream cheese  and powered sugar like Cinnabon frosting but it's bright green."

"As part of a midweek kids' program at our church, I ate green eggs and ham on Dr. Seuss Day. The cooks in the kitchen did a great job and everything was delicious. But things definitely didn't go according to plan. 

Most of the kids, like the one in the book, would not eat the green eggs (some did eat the ham though). All they did to the eggs, of course, was put green food coloring in them. Nope, they weren't having it."
"they do, You gotta put it in for a few seconds, maybe 10-15 Experiment with it"
"My dude, bring water to a boil, put the (room temperature) egg(s) in once it‚Äôs boiling, set a timer for 5 minutes, remove the eggs from the boiling water and dunk them in cool/cold water to cool them down and stop coking them. After a few minutes, peel and check consistency. If it‚Äôs too runny, try 6 minutes the next time. If it‚Äôs not runny enough, try 4. Adjust until your eggs are perfectly runny, remember that number and treat yourself at your whim.

Edit: just saw what they‚Äôre supposed to lol like. Start with 3 minutes at first instead of 5."
"The bread must be green, not pink!"
Lmao bread to microtransactions.

"Pandan ice-cream is delicious! I used to work at a parlour in Malaysia that serves it and it's one of the flavours I would want full scoops of even when not working. Thai tea ice-cream is good too, and would actually pair really well with pandan if you're ever keen to try both together."
It‚Äôs hard to not love a nice refreshing bowl of buko pandan

"Duude me too. I can't make it myself cause we don't have an oven :c I'll have to call my grandma to make some for us soon. Godd there's nothing better than fresh, warm, spongy pandan cake"
Finally
English sucks.
How the fuck has it taken me this long to realise the incorrect grammar in that team name? Fuck me.
"I might sound stupid but I personally believe that it used to always be leafs and beliefs etc, but somewhere along the way we began to pronounce the f in way that started to sound like a v. Similarly to how we say learned instead of learnt. In reality learned and learnt are two completely different words but we just pronounce both the same way. I love words and languages, they're so interesting to me. B"
"The second one isn't an exception. It's neither a plural of ""leaf"", nor a form of the verb ""leave""."
listen hear you little shit
I think you meant leafing

"What is Jungle Jim‚Äôs? Lol, it does sound yummy though!"
Gotta rice that flavor up
"I love pandan waffles.

The place by me closed ‚òπÔ∏è I need to find another one."
You should be able to get the frozen leaves from asian groceries. Just have to boil them to get the essence out
You can buy pandan extract in the asian section at woolies.
I also need to know where to buy pandan in Australia. Preferably Sydney but I‚Äôd probably travel for it.

I just did a one second search and I can get green kaya on amazon.
Just had a friend bring back a couple of jars from Singapore. It has a wonderful flavor. First time I tried it was in ice cream.
Yeos kaya spread. We have it at all Asian grocers in Canada. States should be no exception. Unless you live in alabama lulz.
"As a person from singapore and now in the US, 100% agree."
"It is actually not difficult to make a simple kaya. It is just a egg custard spread,  that you impart coconut, gula melaka (local brown sugar) and pandan flavours into.

Edit. You can find frozen pandans in most Asian grocers or ask your local South East Asian restaurant where to get it. Or find a baking specialist store and find pandas extract"
Brown seems to have brown sugar or something. I vastly prefer green kaya also.
"The brown version is called 'Hainanese kaya', & is associated with the overseas Hainanese Chinese community. The kaya is caramelized with sugar & honey, & is also available in orange (added colouring).

The green version is called 'Nonya kaya', & is associated with the Peranakan (Straits Chinese) community. The kaya is flavoured with pandan."
"Soooooooooo... it's kaya and pandan kaya? Cause my nearby supermarkets never have any green kaya, so hearing pandan in kaya is actually new to me.

PS: Also a Malaysian!"

"Reddit is really ass backwards sometimes. Of all the things to complain about, a fucking holiday? sad"

Why just Alabama?
Let me just pop over to the pandan store first.
IIRC brown kaya uses normal white sugar that is cooked to be caramelised then added to the kaya mix :) ...Well atleast thats what i do.

"Learning English is easy. The grammar is very basic (at least compared to every other language I've studied) plus it's pretty much EVERYWHERE so you pick up a lot just by listening to music, watching movies, reading stuff on the internet...

If you think English is random, don't try learning German."
"I know a guy who has English as his Third Language (Family friend from South Africa, Speaks Afrikaans and Zulu). Dude has somehow put our language in a stranglehold and made it say uncle. This guy has pretty much mastered the language tot he point where you wouldn‚Äôt even think he was ESL. Dude spits out slang and like it was finished gum.

Honestly, learning French was difficult enough for me but some people out there are probably tackling three or more languages. Shits pretty respectable."
We don't have gendered articles. That's the only thing I like about learning/teaching children the English language compared to other Romance/Germanic languages. Most of our rules are broken as often as they're enforced.
Another one of those English rules that you just kinda know if you use the language enough. Thanks!

"Native English speaker here, spent time learning German. Really it's not that bad from a pronunciation standpoint; if someone speaking nice and clear Hochdeutsch says I word I've never heard before, I've generally got a pretty good idea how it's spelled, whereas English is more of a guessing game. I love how consistent the pronunciation is in German.


But the worst part of German isn't the 3 genders, it's not the case system, even the inflected adjectives. It's the damn verbs! Trennbare verbs are annoying as hell, the prefix of the word goes to the end of the sentence and then when you get there you have to think back to what the verb was because the prefix changes the meaning and there's multiple potential prefixes that can be confusingly similar at times but sometimes a prefix changes these verbs in one way but changes other verbs in a totally different way.  And then sometimes verbs just go to the end of the sentence en masse for a ""fuck you dude, we're verbs and like to confuse the fuck out of you"" party. English's strict subject-verb-object structure is very nice. German is technically subject-verb-object but it's also sometimes subject-verb-object-verb parts or subject-verb-object-verb-verb or every now and then you get one of these words that comes along that verbs are really scared of or some shit because they all hightail it to the end of the clause so they can be far away from him. The verb has to be in the second position (except for when it doesn't ) but apparently it's not a very roomy position because as soon as verb parks his keister there, the first thing he does is boot all the other verbs far away.


It gets confusing because I think in terms of X performed such-and-such action on so-and-so, but sometimes in German it's like ""X did in-XYZ-manner at such-and-such-place on that-particular day to so-and-so VERB."" So you're basically hearing all about X and so-and-so's relationship, their working conditions, the manner in which some mystery action was performed, but you're waiting on the edge of your seat trying to find out just what in the hell X *did* to so-and-so. Ripping off from Mark Twain here, sometimes the writer gets so busy and caught up in describing everything that he runs out of paper and the book is rushed to print anyway and the reader reads this massive thing but gets to the end and never finds out what the hell the verb was. 


Oh and another thing, speaking of books: for some reason, Germans believe that speaking in same verb tense as something is written sounds horribly formal and archaic, so they use a different form of past tense in written vs. spoken language. And they looooove adding words to sentences, apparently they're worried that it sounds too harsh if they don't use more syllables, so naturally the simpler verb tense (simple past) is only used in written language, the one that's more syllables and more confusing is the ""less stuffy"" one and that's what you'll hear in conversation. 


For anyone interested, check out Mark Twain's ""The Awful German Language"". Some of it no longer applies because the language has changed and the spelling has become more consistent (gotta love spelling reforms!), but his parts about the verbs are still dead-on."
"THIS

I can only speak English and quite a bit of German, as much of my family speaks it and my grandmother is a German immigrant. German articles SUCK. Der, die, das, dem, den, des. And der/die/das changes if it‚Äôs accusative, genitive, dative, etc. The one great thing about English is the word THE. Just the. The man, the woman, the person, the people, etc."

That's why I'm gonna grab a portal gun when we raid area 51
Air also has to flow to that warm or cold place. Enough people with portals and that place wouldn‚Äôt be so warm or cold
You wouldn't need air conditioning anymore only if the cost of opening and maintaining a portal was cheaper than the air conditioning witch i doupt.
"In the wrong hands, this is world ending."
Now you're thinking with portals!
"I mean, that would probably be like using a nuclear power plants production of energy to cool your house, but sure."
Would the pressure differential suck all of the air through one way? With one in every house it might completely mess up the global wind currents.
We wouldn‚Äôt need porn either. Just portal random bedrooms until you find one that suits you.
One portal on Earth. One portal in space. Boom. Dead planet.

"Unless the energy goes from your space into the other.

Haha. That would be a funny skit. Someone keeps making a portal to your place for free air and just keeps opening it somewhere else in your house every time you try to cover it. Eventually they are stealing your food. After a week they are sleeping with your SO. You SO and pets move to the new place. In the end you just move over with them and it becomes a buddy com. I think Simon Peg and his two friends should make this movie. You guys just never pay for all the power and stuff because you live in a parallel dimension.......wait. What if it was another version of you?"
 Or just make it 20 feet up in the air
"I like your temperature control concept of portals.  A great practical use of science or magic depending on your portal generation source.  
I recommend reading ‚ÄúThe Lost Gate‚Äù by Orson Scott Card. In the book, gates are portals formed by magic (think Dr. Strange portals w/o orange glow and hand gestures).  In addition to travel, they are used for spying (espionage rather than creeper), and stealing.
I have had times when driving, where I wished I could put a portal in front of my mouth connected to a bad driver‚Äôs car. I would give them a piece of my mind (‚Äúslow traffic must keep right, Grandma‚Äù), or simply make low mutterings to freak them out. Weird fantasy, I know, but imagining it gives me a chuckle and helps diffuse the stress of the moment."

"This sounds like an ecological nightmare.  If polar ice melt is a concern now, wait until the entire state of Alabama opens portals across the arctic.  Not to mention what sort of crazy weather patterns would be generated by a sudden mass influx of heated air into a cold region.

"""Today at five, 32 people mauled by polar bears after freak air conditioning accident. In unrelated news, polar bears numbers are bouncing back! Experts attribute it to a diet rich in fat."""
I'd just live in a place that's nice all year round and use the portal to commute
"I don't think anyone is taking into account the pressure differential between places. Opening a portal at sea level somewhere in the arctic and piping it into one at say... 2500 feet is going to result in a pressure differential of about 1.3 PSI over an area of let's say 47 square feet assuming a portal about 5 feet by 3...

Unless I'm fucking up my napkin math, would result in a flow rate of 465337 CFM (edit : Probably a fair bit higher because my math is assuming a circular portal). Through your portal. Into your room. You guys have fun with that."
"If portals existed, I promise that the first thing guys would do is put their dick through it."
"By the Poincare-Hopf theorem, the more portals you create (with the exception of one), the number of cyclones that have to exist on earth at any given time goes up. You're gonna get a lot of strange weather patterns."
"Was just saying in another thread, this is probably why most fantasy settings that have magic are set in a medieval-ish technological setting: why would people need to invent new machines and technologies to solve their problems when magic already exists for that?"
It doesn‚Äôt really work like that. Hot air has less pressure than cold air.
"Imagine someone visiting Antarctica and seeing 10,000 portals in the sky"

Depending on the difference of pressure of the places where the portals would be open the air flow could get really aggressive. Imagine if some fool shoot a portal to the moon!
I thought about that but I thought they would be great to end world hunger and health problems. Got exporting meds you won't be able to finish open a portal and toss them into a remote hospital. Got food you can't finish just send out a message offering it to the world. Yes i would like some of your lasagna.
That would cause a real problem since people would keep opening portals to places like Antarctica and the warm air that would from their houses would melt all the icebergs. Basicly this is global warming on steroids
Portals could solve so many world problems if you think about it. Infinite momentum = perpetual motion machine = unlimited clean energy
If portals were real you would have broken physics and can easily produce infinite energy. Make a large beam of steel with teeth on it and just make it fall forever. The teeth turn a wheel which produces electricity. That's probably the most simple way to do it.
Let every mosquito in the Amazon sail straight through that open hole right into your room they see.
"The membrane of a portal doesn‚Äôt allow air to pass through, only solid matter. I suppose you could use a large cardboard box open on both ends, but just opening a portal wouldn‚Äôt be sufficient.

"Out of all the implications that portals would have, this is probably one of the more mundane ones."
"Yah you could also have infinite energy by teleporting mass higher for no cost.  global warming could easily be prevented and reversed by teleporting CO2 into space and out of the atmosphere.  Hunger and dehydration in underdeveloped countries would be easy to fix, cuz a house wife could just drop a meatloaf through a portal into a field of starving African children.  Weapons of mass destruction could be made simply by placing a portal on the target and placing a second in space, in the ocean, or on the sun.  It is highly unfortunate that they violate like every law in physics, unless immense amounts of energy need to be used to create and maintain said portals."
{opens portal to hardhome in westeros}
I like ideas about technologies that don‚Äôt exist or improve because some other technology makes them obsolete. Both real and in fiction.
"If portals existed their would be a lot more unsolved murders. Hell I would be a serial killer every time a person walks in with a cart in the parking lot in the middle of the lane. It would help lower the population at least, I guess. I am sure we can all think of people we want to portal to space."
"That's one of those neat little worldbuilding tidbits that doesn't seem important but could be the basis for a great storyline.   In a 50's American a esque world where people naively take magic and future tech for granted, Chill-O-Matic AC portal technology is as common as it gets.  That is until a very uncommon traveller rudely lands In a steamy witch's living room with some chilling news:  A horrific threat from deep space plans to mobilize an army of nightmares through these portals."
"Bugs:

I would go ahead and guess it would be more efficient to run the AC than to maintain a portal.
So we could just make portals to the sun inside of containment vessels and make sunspot engines?

Wrong. Heat can't move from the cooler to the hotter.
You know portals will need more electricity than air conditioning
"I would have a portal open constantly over my head that opens up over a rainforest. Mmm, that's good air. Also, the soothing sounds of chainsaws and bulldozers."
Wouldn‚Äôt that eventually equalize the air temperature across the planet? Idk what the circumstances would be... but I doubt good
Tiny portals.
"Technically nobody said the portal had to be on the ground, if you can open a portal why not do it 20 ft off the ground, or 1,000 ft in the air. Would definitely solve the polar bear issue."

Build a bootleg portal in the basement and link it to some gravity field in Space-Afghanistan. Exploding the entire planet and killing 30 billion people. 

To which the media will sort of downplay it because 30 billion people when the intergalactic population is in the hundreds of trillions is kind of like a small roadside bomb going off today and killing 3 people."

Currently AC release more energy to the environment than the energy removed from inside the home. With portals it‚Äôs a 1:1 exchange with the only extra energy being that it cost some to start the portal initially.

 Don't forget the cost of getting moon rocks made into paint.

We'd power our energy grid with a portal to the sun so it doesn't really matter so long as the energy cost of a portal is less than the energy output of a star.

"People would be too lazy to portal properly and wait for queues as is inevitable when a lot of people have easy access to the same place. Amazon would still be incredible as their warehouse does all the brain work and instantly just portals your thing to you, right onto your desk"
Working at the Amazon warehouse would be just yeeting things into a portal to someone's house.
"Imagine the government's powers if portals existed. Police would show up in an instant to arrest someone. The government can spy on people through portals, and the military can instantly invade somewhere through a portal"
"Not if it's localized inside buildings, it wouldn't have any more effect on outside temps than heating or cooling your house already does"

You say that until you remember that the only way portals can be conducted is on surfaces painted with moon dust gel... In which the moon would be destroyed to harvest that much dust
This deserves more upvotes. I'd be curious to see the impact of millions of people opening portals to the arctic and millions to the equator.

Can't go too high or the low atmospheric pressure would pull the air out of your house instead.
Its only possible to create portals against specific walls
"It‚Äôs only a 3-5 degree difference per 1000 feet on average depending on how dry the air is.  Regardless of whether you go up or out into other cooler regions with your portal, it would be wise to keep in mind the potential difference in atmospheric pressure.  Even the difference between high and low pressure weather systems on the ground could cause considerable damage to areas near the portal especially if it‚Äôs small.  It‚Äôs fascinating to think about.  I‚Äôd be happy to hold your beer and watch from a safe distance while you try it out."

Tiny portals
"Yes, but is this actually better or worse? Let's explore the idea. For the sake of discussion, let's assume that the portals use no electricity and do not generate any heat on their own.... Mostly because if we assume that they use electricity this entire idea falls apart real quick. 

Now you have a world where no electricity used for heating or cooling, which would be a huge HUGE change. Air-conditioning releases more heat into the ambient air outside and we still create greenhouse gasses to make electricity for heat and aircons.

On top of this, what if you could use a small portal to control the temp of your car without the added drag of Windows down or reduced fuel economy of aircons.

But wait, you wouldn't ever need a car ever again. No one would. Instant travel to anywhere. 

I feel like this might be huge for improving global warming issues..."

"Honestly portals that common would be an ecological disaster far worse than global warming. The global homogenization of temperatures would eventually stop most currents both in the air and sea. The oceans would go anoxic and we would finish the mass extinction we are in. More so, said technology would have to be very regulated to prevent insane acts of terrorism. For example opening one end in a deep ocean and the other end, well, pretty much anywhere would give you a water laser capable of cutting down mountains and poisoning the land with salt water."

"True, but a 1000 feet wouldn't make any difference. And if you were trying to cool a place down, pulling air out of your house might be exactly what you want. A heat pump works by removing heat from your house to cool the house down."
"The right way to do it would be to have an appliance in the home that has the portal inside, and the other portal is inside an enclosed structure somewhere cold, so that even if there‚Äôs a massive pressure difference there won‚Äôt be airflow.  You‚Äôd just have conductive coils running through the portal and a fan on either end.  In reality the coil on your end will be absorbing the heat around you and the coil in the arctic will be releasing it."
Doctor strange did not seem to agree.
"Moon dust.  So, those walls, or the moon"
"Ok, put a wall on a tall pole."
Or any surface coated with Conversion Gel
There is a fantasy series of books that have a series of planets in parallel universes where portals pop in and out of existence near the surface of the planet over moderately long time periods. Occasionally there are odd alignments such as deserts and frozen tundra causally connected and these lead to micro biomes of severe conditions. Or high cliffs and rivers that erode and pour out into the joined world. Writer does a good job of imagining the problems that could occur with such topologies. Too bad I can't remember the name of it at the moment.

That's how you get sea eagles
"1000 feet above your house would be about .5 psi lower so it would take a decently strong fan to move air into your house. The key would be finding somewhere with good air quality, the desired temperature and higher pressure than your house. Pulling air out of your house will just get your air replaced by outside air which is essentially like opening a window. Works if outside is better than inside but that‚Äôs pretty rare."
Generally if you are trying to cool your house it is even hotter outside. A portal to a lower air pressure location would probably make the situation worse. The air inside your house would go through the portal leaving a pressure gradient with the hotter outside. That hotter air would seep in through cracks and make your house warmer.
Actually you might be surprised how much pressure difference 1000ft would make.  Not sure what would win out of this and the temp difference. Now I‚Äôm sad that this isn‚Äôt real so I can‚Äôt test it.
">A heat pump works by removing heat from your house to cool the house down.

Heat =/= hot air. Heat pumps don't pump the air out, they pump the heat out of the air. 

If you pump air itself out of a room, it'll just get replaced by the air from outside (which may or may not be cooler) so this isn't guaranteed to cool your room."
">And if you were trying to cool a place down, pulling air out of your house might be exactly what you want. 

Eh, no. That's just ventilation, not air conditioning, meaning that in a warm climate, the air sucked out of the house would just be replaced by warm outside air.

It wouldn't even matter what the temperature high up in the sky portal would be since that air would never flow in your house because of the pressure difference.

>A heat pump works by removing heat from your house to cool the house down.

Yes, by removing heat, which ventilation doesn't do unless it's cooler outside than in the house."
Let's not over-complicate this.  You put a 1000ft portal for the incoming air and a 1250ft portal for the outgoing air.. done.
"We need to know what kind of portal.  Doctor strange or portal gun portals?

Hole up, bruh. We're melting the ice caps and we have ZERO portals.

Your second point may have merit, but I'm no astrophysicist."
but how much electricity do we need for the portals?
It would also be mono-directional because of air pressure difference. If I open up a portal in my apartment and the other at the top of Everest it would suck me and my dog in and throw us hundreds of feet through the air.
"The issue isn't if the portals are large or small, the issue is if they are easy and energy efficient as a car, for example, is there will eventually be billions of them. Also air doesn't exchange 'all over the earth', as in all energy exchange is local and continuous."
You can just give each other hugs with portals
"Could you actually fuck yourself in the ass with portals though? Seriously.

Some people may not understand but I seriously empathize with the guards in this situation.

"Honestly, at this point the government should just come out and say - yep there are aliens but they don‚Äôt appear to be harmful and we don‚Äôt know much else‚Äôs and in two days everyone will just go back to their lives."
"Blah blah blah, mister Freeman."
"And here I am wondering why these people look so fucking creepy....they're not real, that's why. Ha."
Area 51 stuff always reminds me of Half Life

Are you kidding? Who do you think deals with the aliens when they escape their holding cells? Those guards must deal with the worst of the worst. Especially when the aliens take over the minds of all the scientists.

"Funny story: a while back, my brother was a researcher in one uni (prefer not to say which) and they were running tests where they release GPS detecting devices -along with other things- to the space. One of these devices landed unintentionally at Area 51. The authorities there found it but refused to give it back, the funny part is, the GPS kept running for a good period of time and my brother and other reseachers were able to track where the device was being taken for some time."

Blue Shift disagrees strongly
Cprl. Sheppard disagrees.
Literally playing through Opposing Force for the first time right now. Holy shit Gearbox's Race X are so much more terrifying than the creatures in every other game.
"Too bad it won't ever get a sequel because

\- Gearbox owns the characters (probably)

\- Gearbox's relationship with Valve is a bit strained right now with the whole Borderlands 3 Epic thing

\-Valve will never make or greenlight an official Half-Life game (unless it is unofficial like Project Borealis, Boreal Alyph, and Black Mesa)"
Fuck the sewers
Agreed. Blue Shift was the weakest of the series.

It's not a game per say. The character models are from half life 2 with what looks like HD armor from half life 1. The scene was likely made in SFM or Garry's mod.

If there's nothing to hide then why do they need to shoot people who want to see it?
I played that game
"They probably won't kill people. But the area denial and riot control weapons they have are pretty effective.  The military has weaponized sound and microwaves for pretty much exactly this purpose.  And let's not forget, they're keeping an eye on the rumors going around for sure.  They'll be prepared. They'll probably only resort to bullets if a large scale perimeter breach is actually imminent or if some dumbasses start shooting at them."
"I wish as well but some redditors reminded me that it's hard to get a signal out there. Hopefully some record it and upload when they get back to their homes or hotel.


Gonna grab a huge bucket of popcorn and just watch"

"> Big brains on websites like reddit think the people who signed up are serious about going when they‚Äôre obviously not. 

I've read 6-7 threads about this on reddit.

"Based on Valve's recent additions to the Half-Life universe, I don't think we will."
"GMan has powers and motivations incomprehensible to us, yet he too answers to a higher power. Is it the vortigaunts? The Combine overlords? Or something nobody has ever seen before?

I think Valve intended to unravel the mystery in one final installment to the Half-Life series, but lost motivation. Or perhaps they bit off more than they could chew and couldn't figure out how to end it."
Oh my god this is seriously what's going to happen.
"Yeah, this is why you don't publicly announce your plan of attack"
"Well that depends on what all‚Äôs there. Pretty easy to move an aircraft with a fancy experimental engine, or anything small enough to shove in a cargo jet. It‚Äôs gotta be lots harder to move anything much bigger than that though."

YOU ARE MY BRO AND I KILLED NEXT BOSS
Here for the same reason too
Uh I'm putting the number at like 259 people actually going there to watch this shit and then like 3 reporters. Maybe 5 dudes show up with a plan to do something but then realize they're fucked and just act like they're there to watch or just leave altogether
"Maybe 40 people show up and of those 40 people none of them are actually willing to storm Area 51. A couple fringe media outlets show up to cover it just for the story in case something happens but they all go home without any incident. Well, maybe a little dehydration and sun burn."
"Yeah for sure, but right now it's at like 410k going and 500k more interested. It's just a meme so I'm sure nobody actually shows up"
"The state isn't going to shoot 400,000 people will they?  
  
That will be tianman square 2.0 and it will only make Area 51 even more controversial. What can possibly be so secret they'll kill thousand to protect it?"
"A fraction of one percent.

It's so weird that this Area 51 thing is ""real"" but thousands of people aren't signing up to go protest these horrific detention center."
"A tenth of 400,000 is still ~~4000 people~~ a fucking shit ton of people"
"3 people talking, a sound guy that doesn't know what he's doing, and a bartender mad that the band is using their drink tokens."
So what you are saying is that maybe 10 people at best will show?
Very big reliability

"Well, HLVR doesn't have a three in it so let's make that a solid never."
What's nice is that they got Gordon's original voice actor to agree to reprise his role in this.
It's a masterpiece
"It is seriously impressive stuff. The author's work is as funny now as it was back then.

The author writes for PCGamer now and his articles still have that humour in them.

If you're looking for more from the guy, his Living in Oblivion series is definitely worth a read. It stars yet another clumsy oaf as the ""protagonist"".

He also had a short lived satirical news site (like the Onion) that reported on stories from inside video game worlds. This is one of my favorites: http://www.screencuisine.net/firstpersonobserver/local/elite-soldier-injured-after-accidentally-firing-rocket/"
"Holy shit, hes still making them?! That's wild, I never thought that's something I'd get more of"

"It's a weapons testing facility. There are 15-20 miles between the fence and entrances to the base, and another 50 outside covered by cameras and guards. 

They could have a bomber in place to drop 10-20 bombs on the crowd and take out hundreds of thousands just like that. The ones left over would be rounded up, arrested, or mowed down."

A type of base where you don‚Äôt have the issue warnings
"Delta is allegedly a special ops program where they allegedly do alleged activities. 

Real talk, no civilian knows what they do for a fact, but they‚Äôre a poorly kept secret military program, and the secrecy has lead to awesome conspiracies. The only common factoids between accounts is that when approaching their barracks they‚Äôre allowed to shoot on site; and that it‚Äôs a conglomerate of older special ops from various branches of the military. I like to imagine they roll up in a van Ateam style."

Literally 90% of them wouldn‚Äôt even make it close and would be crying in the dessert. There would be bumper to bumper traffic and everyone would run out of gas halfway there.

I have never before seen such an adorable parrot in my entire life.
Fuck this picture is cute!
"Definitely broken, if he doesnt even say ""Woof"" too."
Cutest parrot ever!!
Best parrot ever
Where is the other half of the dog? :(
"No, thats a squirrel"
"You're right. He should also be saying ""woof"" and ""ruff."""
"At least your can say bark, mine says woof."
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
"Your Funko Pops are broken, too. They look like Mighty Muggs."
I 100% would kick it with OP

He seems to like his perch. Has the parrot food been working okay?
Your adorable parrot has big ears for a parrot
a perfect and handsome boy!!!
"Dont take him around old people, bark is a four letter word in some places."
There‚Äôs a good chance his ears are broken too. My parrot is deaf and he likes to sing for attention.

The parrot who I'm looking at is cute AF -- the one with the dog on his shoulder.
"Funny story. My family had a bunch of budgies when I was growing up. We always taught them a few simple phrases like ""pretty birdie"" and ""hello"". Most of them would pick them up no problems, but one in particular refused to say anything, ever.  
  
Then, one spring one of our cats had some kittens and we put the box right under reticent bird's cage. The bird was mewing like a kitten for months."
"Oh dude, give him a kiss on that big ol' space between his eyes for me!"
Too cute. You're funny. Imma follow you now if that's ok.

"I'm dog sitting my brothers ex's chihuahua. It's less weird in reality than it sounds when I say it. Point is he loved getting on my brothers shoulders. He did it to me and I didn't know how to get him off safely and I was already leaning forwards so I was kinda just stuck there until the dog got bored of it.

So for mental picture I was sitting down leaning forward slightly with my arms in a sofa. Oh he doesn't sit like that he is standing up on the two shoulders going across the back of the neck."
The parrot's nails lools like there digging into his skin
"Them Funko Pops, tho."

That dog looks like it‚Äôs only got 2 front legs and a tiny body. I can‚Äôt unsee it.
He's just bilingual.
That's one good parrot

"Beautiful plumage, don't you think?"
"Man, that's ruff."
His eyes do appear to be looking in different directions. Did you check the user's manual?
Yeah his feathers don't look good either. Has he seen his vet? Does he get to socialize with other parrots? This has been seen occasionally. Chronic Loss of Identity in Parrots.

I love our boston terrier.  Ours is 7 months old.  Does yours love to chew on everything?  She also loves to hide her bones.
Theyre so sweet. I‚Äôve never seen one with so much white fur.
Do you have to put sun cream on him when you go out? I heard dogs need it when they are so white like this

"Posting about someone's flaws obviously makes you an asshole. I just admitted I did think about him as a shirtless fat guy with tattoos and a beard.

He can lose weight, he could shave, he chose the tattoos. But being bald he can't control, and that's why making fun of bald men makes you especially an asshole."

Is he deaf? The white head Boston I know was born deaf
Ours finally grew out of chewing. RIP my favorite sandals. Totally worth it.

"He is not. Maybe hard of hearing, or seems like it at times. He listens selectively."
I‚Äôm the map
Oh ok
"You're lucky! Most white head Bostons are deaf due to a genetic defect, you lucked out!"
"That‚Äôs a breed standard.. my Boston hears food in his dish , the word treat, and car ride... outside of that...."
My Boston is all brindle and is selectively ‚Äúhard-of-hearing‚Äù at all times. Don‚Äôt let them fool you.
"idk if i can trust this, Mr. LyingForTruth"
"I got a high white (splash) purebred Boston Terrier too! She got blue eyes and hears perfectly, even at 7 y/o. No vision sensibilities or problems either. A good healthy pup.

Never saw a white headed BT dead or blind. Its just the white splash genetic. They are not like australian shepherds. Not saying its impossible tho but I think its more of a myth than an actual truth that most white head BT have issues.

EDIT:
Here's my bugger (sadly not a broken parrot)

Outside of that he hears his name... When he wants to.
Not sure if I believe you.  Have you been drinking?
"I think if my toys had been alive and actively searched for missing pieces when I was away, they would lose pieces less often too."
My kids never lost their woody doll's hat but they did break his head in half.
"This issue is addressed in TS2 when the chicken guy finds woody at the yard sale. He is excited to find woody, but then almost lost his shit when he saw the hat there too."
"Also, in Toy Story 4, he said he was made in the 1950s. He‚Äôs held up very well considering

SPOILERS AHEAD ON THIS THREAD, AS WELL AS SOME HEAVY EXISTENTIAL DISCUSSION

EDITED TO ADD THE SPOILER COMMENT"
No stains. Not. A. Single. Stain.
Can confirm. As a child I had a Woody doll. Hat confirmed gone after one day.
"Toy Story 2 thought me that a sentient six-inch toy horse would run faster than both a real horse and a cheetah, reaching a top speed of about 180 mph to match speeds with a commercial jet liner during takeoff."
I guess the most unrealistic thing isn't that the Toys are alive
He probably gets it back himself.
"From what I remember, Woody is constantly going out of his way to pick up his hat when it falls off. So the fact that he's alive is why he still has his hat."
"Didn't he have a gun to? Like that fat prospectors, he got a pickaxe, and jessy got a horse. What did woody have before?"
"While we‚Äôre on the subject, my favorite Toy Story related shower thought is ‚Äúthink how much the toys in Toy Story had to watch Andy explore his body over the years.‚Äù"
[Here he is without a hat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sZr_XB2D4sk)
"If y‚Äôall figure out the situation with Woody‚Äôs hat, can y‚Äôall try figuring out how all them The Land Before Time kid dinos survived 14 movies?"
He doesn‚Äôt have marks-a-lot on his face either.
"maybe when his kid left the room and he came alive, he finds his hat"
"I've got my Woody since 1995 , still has his hat"
the most unrealistic thing about Toy Story for me is that all the toys still lookin' fuckin' brand new.
"What about Mr. and Mrs. potato head?  We got a Mr. potato head for our kids last year, and he‚Äôs down to a body and one arm..."
Isn't it 24 years?
"No, I'm pretty sure it's the talking sentient children's toys."
My Woody still has his hat. The pull string on his back is broken but he's still got all his parts.
Thats the most unrealistic thing?
Damn. And I always thought it was the sentient toys being the most unrealistic thing. But I am an idiot.
I‚Äôve had a woody toy for 14 years and he still has his hat.
"I too am uncircumcised

oh was that not what this is about?"
Uh the first movie came out in 1995 which was 24 years ago.
Or that the toys still exist in general lul
And his badge
He can remember where it is and retrieve it though...
"Hold up, more unrealistic than the toys coming to life in the movie? Because that's pretty unrealistic to me."
"Woody's roundup was a 40+yo show by the time Toy Story 2 rolled around. 

It's impressive to have the hat for 14 years.. incredible to have it 50+ years."
it‚Äôs a movie about fucking sentient toys
"Andy took good care of him, Bonnie would've lost his hat, if she didn't abandon him first"
"Hate to mess your day up, but Toy Story came out in 1995... Not 2004... It's 24 years."
"The most unrealistic thing? It‚Äôs not the talking, moving toys?"
"The thing that bothered me the most was the Skunk RC car.  Theres a sentient RC car in the toy story universe, So Bo Peep would be riding around In Toys hollowed corpse"
No it's not. The most unrealistic thing about Toy Story is the conscious toys.
I have to disagree. I have a Geordi LaForge figure from the early 90's and dude STILL has his V.I.S.O.R. For whatever that's worth.
And his batteries aren't dead and his pull string isn't broken or tangled. Can't wait for number 5 when his voice box starts to sound like a dying jukebox
"Woody does lose his hat in Toy Story 2, but because he's sentient he finds it."
Living toys seem pretty unrealistic to me but hey why not
No the most unrealistic part is that there are talking toys
Right I get this on r/memes was a Toy Story meme
"Agree, 2nd thing would be that the toys come to life."
He‚Äôs alive so he would find it obviously
Or the fact that slinky hasn‚Äôt been tangled
"My GI Joes hated me for losing all their guns. Then I gave them some knockoff ones I bought at Big Lots, but they know...they know."
Or that Barbies kept all their shoes tbh
His was a central theme in one of the movies
Another unrealistic thing is the lack of discarded fast food toys. Those things are fucking everywhere but Toy Story.
I lost my Woody's hat pretty early on. I accidentally left it at the beach. I cried. A lot.
"No. The most unrealistic thing is any kid of the last 30 to 40 years even having a cowboy toy with a pull string or even having any of those toys to begin with. Andy would have had whatever the hot toy was in 1995. Power Rangers or whatever it was, I don't remember, not stuff from the 1950s."
"Pretty sure ""the toys being alive"" is the most unrealistic thing about Toy Story."
The most unrealistic part is that they never caught Andy masturbating
Nobody but you:  The most unrealistic thing about Toy Story is that after 14 years Woody still has his hat.
I was thinking that 4 movies with a buzz and a woody that there has been zero sex.
I have a woody from the first toy story movie. He lost his hand and the pull string but he still has his hat!
how much of the toy is... alive? when does it go from plastic to sentient life?
Also we find out in Toy Story 4 that his badge comes off! How did that not get lost?
No I think the most unrealistic thing is that toys can talk and are sentinient
It would be much more impressive if Woody could still maintain his woody ü§£
"Shit, i have 99% of my gundam accessories."
What about the fact that there‚Äôre toys that literally think and speak...
Do both of Buzz's spring loaded wings work? One of them should have broken by the end of the second movie.
Woody goes mad when he can't find his hat - if the toys didn't move then sure but I'd imagine a missing hat would certainly be a mission for the bucket army
Our Woody did lose his hat and my dad accidentally shot off his hand with an arrow while practicing his archery.
Hm I don‚Äôt think this is he MOST unrealistic thing
My woody still has its hat after 25yrs üòè
"Sheriffs badge too, shocked when that thing popped off"
I still have the fisher price castle with all the little guys and all 3 cannonballs. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs too much of a stretch. But that‚Äôs just IMHO
I took care of my shit because I wasnt gonna get more.
More unrealistic than talking toys with emotions and feelings?
Irresponsible fuckin' sheriff lost his goddamn service pistol and almost got his head blown off by an egotistical space man.
Or maybe the talking toys....
It's only been 14years wtf
I always thought the most unrealistic part was during the first toy story when Buzz thinks he is a real space ranger he plays ‚Äúdead‚Äù when humans are around like the other toys.
Magic hat.
Christmas 2002 I received a Jango Fett action figure. I lost one of his two blasters a few months before the following Christmas. Never found it again.
Even more unrealistic that a toy has a hat not attacked to it's head. I mean it's almost impossible to find a toy with guns and small details not glued to the toy
I still have my hat from 5th grade.
"My kids have had at least four different Buzz Lightyear toys over the years. One lost an arm (same as in the first movie), another lost a head, another's wings won't stay closed anymore, and the fourth one's right arm won't stay down. But the voice still works, the laser still works, the helmet still does that ""whoosh"" thing, and the legs haven't broken.

Both of the Woody dolls we've had are still intact and voices working, and we've managed to keep the hats too.

Potato Head, on the other hand. Haven't seen him or any of his accessories in years. The fact that Mr. And Mrs. Potato Head in the movies both have all of their facial features, let alone any other parts, is just amazing."
Almost a fluke that 'woody hat' was never a  nickname for condoms.
He did temporarily lose it in toy story 3
It‚Äôs like sunglasses for humans. Impossible to keep track of.
My woody dolls ass is 2 inches
I still have my original Woody with his hat (it‚Äôs a bit chewed by my dog but oh well)
"Not just Woody‚Äôs hat either.  Slinky is still in good shape (not twisted or stretched too far to recoil).  Mr. Potatohead still has all his parts.  Buzz‚Äôs wings still work, along with the laser light in his wrist.  Rex has all his arms and legs.  Hamm isn‚Äôt broken or cracked.  The list goes on and on."
"24 years

FTFY"
*spoiler alert*
"I once lost a Woody action figure over my neighbours fence. When they found it a few years later, ants had eaten most of its face off."
Also that he has both boots and his vest is intact.
All of those toys are in unrealistically great condition.
I feel like seeing as  Jessie supposedly belonged to Andy's mom and is still in good shape she thought him to respect his toys as she did. They care for their belongings pretty well.
After 14 years my woody still has his hat. He's not scuffed up too bad either. Buzz's dome is pretty foggy though. :(
"He loses the hat in Toy Story 2 and 3. Nothing is unrealistic in that franchise, absolutely nothing..."
"no it's not. woody is a sentient toy who wants to keep his hat. if someone takes it off while playing with him, he will go find it when playtime is over"
My daughter got a Woody doll last week. The hat is gone already.
I have to disagree
I‚Äôve owned a Woody for well over 14 years. He went without a hat for a few years but I recently found it at a clean up at my mum‚Äôs house.
Mine is at least 20 years old and he still has his hat.
More like 24 years! You old; man.
"Well Woody took care of his own hat, not Andy."
I've had my Woody for 14 years and he still has his hat!
"No, I‚Äôd have to say the toys being sentient is probably the MOST unrealistic thing."
After 14 years I‚Äôd still have a woody too
he had his hat stolen for a little bit by Sharky in the first movie. LOOK IM WOODY! HOWDY HOWDY HOWDY.
Clearly this man has never met a real cowboy
Howdy howdy howdy
why do people post about toy story so much in this sub?
what would happen when Andy asks for woody back
Amazing.
24 years!
"All the other is most realistic, including talking toys"
Can a toy have a toy?
Not even 14 years. Woody says that he was made in the late 50's. Assuming 1959 he will have had his hat for 60 years. I call bullshit.
"I‚Äôve had this Kane wrestling figure for about 20 years. He had a removable mask, and wouldn‚Äôt ya know it, he still has that mask."
"I have several of the original run of TMNT toys and I still have many accessories. I lost one of Raph‚Äôs sai to the vacuum cleaner, but that‚Äôs still 30 years of not losing his other sai."
Got my kid a Woody toy a few months back. Hat never stood a chance.
"Well he mentioned that he was a toy from the 50s, so that‚Äôs double impressive."
"Funny enough I only have the woody hat left, no idea where the rest is"
"no, the most unrealistic thing is that andy wasn't playing fortnite"
I thought it was that someone found joy
14? 24 mate
It isnt that the toys have feelings? Are you sure?
And not the toys talking right?
"Hey after almost twenty years I still got the hat!

Lost the cow leather jacket, though."
Mines had his about as long
Sure.. other than the fact toys can't talk. But sure Woody still has his hat is by no doubt the most unrealistic thing bout THAT movie
"""Hi I'm Woody! Howdy howdy howdy."""
We buried ours in the snow as kids
"Lmao, this is so true! We actually did buy my son a woody doll once, hat went missing within a week. We once also got him a Maui doll, the skirt went missing too and now we have a naked Maui."
Definitely not the talking toys part though.
The most unrealistic thing about toy story is that woody is still hard
You mean 24 years?
Dr. Indiana Jones liked your post.
24 years
"""*gasp* Finally! ...hey, who's got my hat?""  
  
""Hey look, I'm Woody! Howdy howdy howdy.""  
  
""Ah ha. Ah haaa... Gimme that."""
"Tell that to Dr. Henry Jones Jr. who kept the same hat for over 45 years, at the least"
I had a toy woody a while ago and lost the hat after a week :(
"I got a toy Woody when I was a kid, and many many years later, he‚Äôs sitting in my basement, still with his hat on."
It came from an Alan Quartermain figure originally.
That's why he's such a valuable collectors item! ü§ë
Clearly you've never seen Indiana Jones
14 years? And the rest.
"Yeah, but that toy won't be finding missing pieces if I lose them in the middle of nowhere"
"Yeah, like wasn't there a part in one of the movies where he did go without his hat for a while? Also, Andy didn't just lose Woody's hat in the first movie, he lost both Woody and Buzz entirely. Granted, that was kinda Woody's fault, but we still got the stereotypical mom response at the end (see? In the car, right where you left them ü§™)."
"When I was younger I had a set of Karate Kid toys. Daniel LaRusso's action figure had a bit of a skinny fat/beer belly physique. All the Cobra Kai characters were totally ripped. I always thought it was silly that the hero had a fat body.

On morning I woke up and the heads had been switched. 27 years later I still assume they heard me talk about it and  switched their heads for me."
True like how in Toy Story 4 Mrs Potato Head was missing an eye but managed to find it.
I have lost way too many Lego and Bionicle pieces to the all-devouring carpet dimension
"Yeah that would've been awesome and maybe my toys would've ""lived"" longer. But props to Andy because Mr & Mrs Potato Head seem to have all their parts after all those years."
"Like Forky kind of addressed my when-is-a-toy-a-toy-and-thus-alive ponderances, I now want to see what happens to a toy when the head gets broken in half."
"Ours too! Well, more accurately, a neighborkid smashed Woody's head in so my daughter gave him a funeral service.  üòû But he still had his hat."
Was it the authentic woody that was like 75$ too!?
"Fella near our house hit a lamppost. He had a helmet on, but his head come off."
This is a real toy story. Literally
I was gonna say...my daughter got a woody doll like three years ago. She got him out to play with when they started playing previews for the new movie. By some miracle of God there was a part of my mom brain that remembered where his damn hat was.
Did they pull the string then slam him on the ground while he was talking?
The exact same thing happened to my brother's Woody! Didn't know other people had this happen
"So I guess you can say that owning a woody doll was a

real headsplitter?"
I work at the movie theater so I see all the kids coming in with their Woody dolls. I rarely see one with a hat still on.
My mom glued the hat on lol
Amazing level of detail
"You know, I wonder if Al had actually been up front to start with and offered a fair price to Andy's mom for Woody, if she wouldn't have just said yes. The dude first tried to hide Woody under a bunch of other stuff and scam her and then just straight up stole him.

I know that there's some kind of backstory that they never really get into about Woody being a family heirloom (which is why Andy's mom doesn't sell him to Al, plus why else would Andy have a cowboy doll from the 50s?) but overall it's pretty hilarious to think about how Al probably could have gotten away with the whole thing and made an obscene amount of money (it was implied that he's selling the full set to the museum in Japan for the ballpark of tens to hundreds of thousands) had he not cheaped out and instead just offered Andy's mom a few hundred bucks for Woody saying he was a huge fan and collector.

Actually, now that I remember the ending, Al would have also succeeded if he'd gone with his original plan and paid however much it cost to get everything FedExed instead of taking it all on the plane with him. Woody was excited about the idea of going to the museum at that point and wouldn't have even met back up with Buzz and the others at all if Al had let the FedEx guy pick all of them up at the same time they picked up all the other merch. And from Al's point of view, all he knows is that he lost out on hundreds of thousands purely because he opted to trust the toys to American Airlines rather than pay for the overnight shipping. No wonder he's so upset at the end of the movie.

Also, I didn't realize until just now that Al the Chicken Man was played by Newman, which makes all of the above that much better. If you only watch the Al scenes, the movie is basically just a Kramer and Newman scheme gone wrong, complete with the end of episode comeuppance because they forgot to do something obvious."
He pooped his Cheeto
But woody is missing his gun. This never gets acknowledged and kinda upsets me.
Newman!
He did get repaired in Toy Story 2
"I want to know why he's so attached to Andy, he went the first 30 years of his life without him"
Must be all that plastic surgery
He belongs in a museumüò°
Spoilers or what
Yeah wtf is that? What did he do between the 50s and when Andy got him? Did Andy get an old ass toy from his dad or grandfather? Why does Woody never mention this? I noticed that line the first time I saw it and I've been stuck thinking about what that means lore wise since
He talks? What a spoiler
"Whoa, Toy Story 4 is out already?  I had no idea it was even being made until yesterday."
"Yep, he has such fond memories of Andy, but they never talk about before Andy.  I think in Toy Story 2 they say he was a family heirloom.  Maybe there will be a Toy Story prequel next."
"Jessie was also made in the fifties while buzz is brand new, so in a lot of ways, she‚Äôs a paedophile"
You know what? Maybe he‚Äôs just SANITARY.
Arm got torn off tho
Buzz Lightyear still has his sticker. Thats impossible.
isnt this addressed in the second movie with the human cleaner character?
It‚Äôs a Tide ad.
"What could toys possibly be doing to get stains though.


Well, besides little bo peep."
He got cleaned in 2
shark took it
"Can not confirm, had a Woody doll for as long as I remember... Hat is still on his head, and he's up on my shelf right now.  


The hat is a little chewed up though, I was one of those children that put basically everything in my mouth"
We bought our three year old a Woody doll. Hat immediately went missing. Needed it for some photography stuff. Found it in her toy oven 3 months later.
Toys don‚Äôt feel pain telling them to stop
"We don't know how the toys move, it's entirely possible that they have superhuman speed and strength."
Especially considering that almost every toy-related problem in the movies stems from them being alive.
"""Talking toys that move on their own yep totally there but can we talk about that fucking *hat*!?"" -OP"
I knew if I scrolled down far enough I'd find a like minded individual.
"He did in TS1, when the shark stole Woody's hat."
Pretty sure it's an Indiana Jones reference in all seriousness.
He had snakes in his boots.
He has a holster but he never had a gun.
A woody
"Bullseye and Jessie wouldn't have been in the same package, they're separate toys. Bullseye isn't in her flashback sequence."
Maybe the badge?
A matchstick.
The gun is actually missing
"I saw one post, it was probably from 4chan considering how messed up it was, about an owner jerking off and cumming on Jessie's face and not cleaning it off, and the other toys comforting her after the owner left because she couldn't clean it off (it would give away that they were alive)."
r/tihi
"Well, there it is."
The Land Before Time 15: The Big Sky Rock
The most unrealistic thing about Toy Story for me is when all the toys come to life any time someone leaves the room.
What about the fact that they‚Äôre living toys..?
"Actually, they made some efforts with this in Toy Story 4. The pic is a little low-res but [here](https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/toy-story-4-teaser-01-ht-jc-190204_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg) you can see Buzz's stickers starting to peel around the edges."
It is
would be closer to 70 since he was made in the 50's
We're talking about a doll right?
"I thought about this too, but I think the movie timeline is only 14 years. He‚Äôs celebrating his 8th birthday in Toy Story and leaving for college at the end of TS3. Those movies came out 15 years apart but only 10 years have passed in-movie."
I don‚Äôt recall them fucking the toys
"Wait, what? You sure about that one?"
yeah i feel like this ‚Äúthe most unrealistic thing about xyz‚Äù format for shower thoughts is a bit exaggerated
Good thing these movies aren't about Eddie Murphy's toys.
I dunno the mistletoe stuff at the end of toy story 1
"No because in the rules set within the show it is perfectly believable that they are alive.  Given that context, I would argue that thebleast believable thing is that no one knows they are alove yet."
Exactly
That‚Äôs when you send in Sarge‚Äôs specially trained Army Men PJs to recover the lost toys.
"Maybe you didn't lose them, the toys got rid of them"
"*checkmate*

Take that you chicken-suited collector!"
I mean the toys literally made into into a city in TS2. I‚Äôm sure this is just a plot for the 8th movie they make
"""Hey look, I'm Woody! Howdy howdy howdy!"""
"He doesn't have it for quite a while in Toy Story 3, until he returns to the Daycare. 

In the second one there is also the high shelf the mother puts toys on that need to be ""fixed"". She later probably bins them but Squeaky fell behind the books so he survived."
Toy Story 3*
Wait if area 51 knew the toys were alive they would use them as security cameras
"In the original Toy Story, Sid would Frankenstein his toys together. As long as it's still recognized as a toy, would still be sentient I guess."
I know this is a dark thought but during the movie I wondered could Forky commit suicide? just pull his feet and arms off. would he cease to be alive then? what part of him defines him as alive?
"Since a toy is alive when their kid recognizes him or her as one, then the parts of the toy that dont have any value for him aren't alive OR he doesn't care about (such as the hat for Woody)"
Ask Sid.
"I assume youve watched toy story 4, and uh in it theres a scene where that exactly happens, or do you mean plastic toys not plushies"
Sid had toys with different parts assembled together... I suppose they would still be alive.
forky only brings up a million more questions about toy sentience.
"..Funeral for a toy..

The roses in the window box

Have tilted to one side

Everything about this house

Was born to grow and die

Oh it doesn't seem a year ago

To this very day

Since Daddy said ""I got this for you honey""

The painted smile always on your face

I can't face another day

And love lies bleeding in my hand

Oh it kills me to think of you with another kid

I was playing nice with you but I was told to always share

But my neighbor couldn't hold you

So he split your head

Love lies bleeding in my hands

I wonder if those changes

Have left a scar on you

Like all the summer days

That you and I passed through

You're a bluebird on a telegraph line

I hope you're happy now


Well if the wind blows toys to heaven 


We'll play again somehow

And love lies bleeding in my hand Oh it‚Ä¶"
r/woodycarnage
I don't remember what they cost at all. We bought Woody and the Jessie dolls for my son and daughter. They're both long gone now.
At least he didn‚Äôt suffer any type of brain trauma.
I have no idea what they were up to but there was great sadness.
Subtle nod
"The last time I watched the movie I noticed the ""add an extra zero"" scene in TS2 and I'm pretty sure AL was on his way to millionaire status. I mean the man owns a toy store so I don't believe he was so hung go for $10,000 and still dancing that your rich with $100,000 seems odd as such a successful businesses owner (seemed like als did good business)... Also its an art (toy?) Museum which doesn't play with rare stuff. So I honestly think he talked his way up from $100,000 to a million, and lost that mil because toys aren't just pieces of plastic. No wonder he is literally crying in his later commercial...."
"The guys at Pixar wrote up a legit backstory about Woody belonging to Andy‚Äôs dad, Andy Sr., who died of post polio syndrome or whatever it‚Äôs called, so there‚Äôs no way Andy‚Äôs mom would ever sell him unless they were about to go bankrupt or something. There‚Äôs a Super Carlin Brothers video about it that‚Äôs really good, link [here](https://youtu.be/bbmzuoBC1Rs)

It also explains why there‚Äôs no pictures of Andy‚Äôs dad around, it‚Äôs a really good story actually"
Awesome.
I can't believe he trusted the airlines after what happened to his box of cookies
The overnight shipping was for all the Woody‚Äôs Round-up merch which is why it wasn‚Äôt there when Buzz and gang showed up. Believe Al was always going to deliver the dolls personally.
"It's kinda fucked up you'd think Andy's mom would have given woody away for any reason. It'd be slightly disturbing for people watching. Because you trust your parents to support you if you really liked a toy or what have you. If it's important to andy it would be important to her because it makes him happy. 

She already said it's not for sale, a clear indication she does not WANT to sell it. It's not like she was hassling a better price out of him. I just dunno where you're coming from, what good parent would do that? As a child I paid close attention to her actions there and that's likely the mind set they had there so if she had ever purposefully given woody away it'd be a huge flaw in the writing. No one would buy that. 

You're looking for a loophole there but there is none, Al recognized this was a child's toy and there was no chance it could be given to him. He had to steal it."
"Yeah. I don‚Äôt want to spoil the new movie; but another repair in that one as well. But 60-70 years and no fading, worn-out spots, stains, scuffs, etc... he‚Äôs in amazing condition considering all the hijinks he gets himself into."
One of the most satisfying scenes in history imo
My guess is he stayed in packaging until Andy found him at a yard sale or second hand store.
Might not have been sold to any kid before then. When he said when he had been made it seemed like he couldn't remember it well so maybe nothing happened really. In toy story 2 we found out that woody was popular till his show got cancelled so he might have been in one of the last batches and might not have been sold
"He gets sort of creepy about it in the last movie.  I think he developed some sort of attachment disorder.  I mean, it sort of evens out.  But even his friends were pretty concerned about it.  Those Toy Stories go to some pretty dark places"
"No.  Turns out, that info came out in the 2nd movie. üëå"
'Tis but a scratch.
And in the 4th movie >!he loses his pullstring too!<
I like that in every toy story film the cotton in his arm just sort of deflaits but it it still slightly bigger than his other arm.
You can see the stitches in 4
"Remember when Buzz and Woody were hanging from a truck. Or tumbling inside a pizza delivery car?

Not. A. Single. Stain."
"Howdy, howdy, howdy"
"A horse is still faster than a remote control car although the car could maybe keep it up for longer. An airport runway is a sprint, not a marathon. Endurance doesn‚Äôt really enter the picture."
Well not strength considering old fat boy couldn't get out of the back pack
Isn't being alive what causes the problems in human-based movies too?
"Which is extremely frustrating in toy story two. The collector even has memorabilia with woodys gun yet no one ever says it‚Äôs missing. I‚Äôm not saying a sherif has to have a gun. But if they have a holster then yeah, they need a gun."
A throwing star?
Now I remember why I never joined that site
How do I unread something?
Wouldn't the toys would just haunt Anon
Pssh. Chucky's real. And even he's seen worse days. üò∞
Yes yes we are
Yeah but how long did Andy have Woody before the first movie? It‚Äôs longer than 14 years regardless of your theory.
"‚ÄúSARGE, WHATS THE STATUS OF WOODY‚ÄôS RIGHT SHOE?!‚Äù
‚ÄúTHATS A NEGATIVE SIR!‚Äù"
It‚Äôs also unrealistic how every single sarge is still In The bucket
"A ha, a ha, gimme that!"
"Oh man, I played with rocks as a kid"
"Here's an odd thought: What about those creepy ventriloquist dummies from this new film? They're not toys uses by children, but entertainment props used by adults to entertain children (and some adults, sometimes). And yet, they still come to life... Voiceless, but alive."
"So in Toy Story 2 if Woody and co. Had went to museum, then they would have been considered as pieces of history, part of museum and therefore not toys? And then their consciousness would have ceased to exist?"
...what about virtual toys? Or video games? Consoles?
Masturbation
"Because a kid's imagination is what gives the toys life in the first place. Anything a kid can imagine being alive, is."
"Another thought is that in toy story 4 in the closet there is a talking ""toy"" chair. But in app essece it is just a small chair. So is furniture alive?  Maybe not since the toy chair is played with in a way this qualifies to be alive. But what about swing sets. They are sat on and played with. Are they alive but can't walk or talk due to it being anchored to the playground and has no mouth to talk.

Additional shower thought"
"Mr Potato Head also put his pieces on a tortilla shell and took control of it, and both Mr and Mrs Potato Head can leave pieces of themselves wherever they want and still control them"
So do sex toys count?
A toy is alive. Adults some times consider cars as grown up toys. Cars are alive.
Potato Head can control all his different parts even when they are not attached to each other (best example is when he connects to the tortilla in the 3rd). It's possible that Forky could also do that or maybe Potato Head has special toy powers since his specific toy was built to be mixed and matched.
"How much of him has to be removed before the kid doesn‚Äôt recognize him as a toy? What if the kid pulls all of his limbs and eyes off, is he just a sentient spork? Blind and motionless? Do his eyes still see like Mr. Potato head? If a kid plays with a regular object, like a fork, without changing it, does the fork gain consciousness temporarily then looses it when the kid is done and puts it away?"
Incineration
"I feel like toys aren't capable of that. I don't know how or why, I just feel like they couldn't be"
"This brings up the idea that if the object is alive when the kid recognizes it as a toy, then it‚Äôs possible that just about anything that enters a child‚Äôs hands will come alive. Like how many keychains are out there longing to relive that initial short burst of attention they took from their child that brought them sentience. Or how many handguns are living with the weight of being brought into existence and immediately destroying their creator."
"But the doll never had a kid, so it's more like ""anything with eyes is a toy"""
"Damn, too bad. Do you still have the toys at least?"
Aww our boys wicked into toy story past few years so we got the Disney exclusive ones with certificates of authenticity and had all the bells and whistles as their big xmas gifts. The head on one the woody's did exactly how you said. I fixed it with some super glue and been good since though.
"True, he is in basically brand new quality somehow"
"Well, He's the very best. He's the rootinest tootinest cowboy in the wild wild west. Did you expect anything less?"
"Also he walks and talks, which is unusual."
"‚Äú60-70 years‚Äù

Am I sensing a prequel origin story for Woody here..."
"I swear I remember a scene where he gets painted, so he may have just been repainted a few times over the years."
Woody of Theseus
Well I'm pretty sure on TS2 he gets painted too

nothing can come close
Hello Newman
He was an old family heirloom. Possibly that Andy's grandfather kept him in packaging until passing him on to andy.
"My headcanon is that toys don't become alive until a kid mentally imbues them with life. So if Woody were sitting on a shelf or in packaging, that would make sense."
Andy's mom claims Woody is an old family toy. popular fan theory is he belonged to Andy's father. than again she could have been lying to try and get Al to leave her alone.
How do you explain then how Gabby Gabby was alive eben though she'd never had a kid.
"[edit: theme spoilers and short overarching examples. Please go see Toy Story 4. Like seriously.]

I think Toy Story 4 is very much a movie about letting go.  Specifically about something that has defined you your whole life.  I think the voice box is a symbol the movies uses to represent Woody's place in the world.  But you can see from the beginning his meaning, his being a leader and favorite toy, is slowly fading away.  Being able to adjust, and take on new meaning, without a kid, without his leadership role, is very scary. I think that's the reason Gabby Gabby's whole entourage is like horror-like.  I think it's supposed to subtly touch on the idea that when we feel our position is threatened, the things that could show us that best are scary to us.  Because it is scary, realizing the identity you've held onto your whole life is no longer...a thing.

I think Toy Story 4's story is most relevant to adults.  People who need to let go of their children would be a really perfect example.  Mother's and father's letting go and suddenly having exist without children.  It has defined their existence for so long.  The thought of someone taking on their roll is terrifying no matter how well they handle it.  But I think it's also true for others.  Someone who has been in a relationship for a long time with someone they dont work well with any more.  Someone with their terminally ill parent.  

Roles in life give us meaning.  Purpose. Letting go of that is HARD and often the first thing we try to do is adapt to a similar role.  Like how Woody does with his new kid.  Letting go of it completely can take a long time before we can accept it.

I don't think Woody acts mentally ill or anything drastic.  I think he just is struggling in a way I've seen many people struggle when suddenly it feels as though their entire life's purpose is... meaningless now.  The subsequent floundering is very difficult for them.

I have to admit when I first heard they were making Toy Story 4, I was annoyed.  Like, c'mon, they're making ANOTHER one?  But now that I've seen it, I think I understand now.  They waited until they had a story to tell, and I think it was an important one.

I believe it's the same guy who directed UP, which also touches on the topic of loss, but that time the loss of dreams coveted, rather than the loss of a purpose lived.  Both are very different but really important to cover."
Alright lucky because I haven't seen the new one yet couldn't have woody being made in the 1950s being spoiled
*A scratch?!* His arm was off!
Thanks for reminding to finish the movie
If only they put that much attention to detail in the writing.
"Immersion ruined.

Literally unwatchable."
Not to mention that Buzz's transparent plastic dome is in perfect condition.  Those thing scratch all to hell just sitting on a shelf.  His dome should be opaque at this point!
A-ha. A-ha. Give me that!
That shark is a gem and needs to return for Toy Story 5. Or 6. Or 9 when they can deep fake all the voiceactors because theyll all be dead of old age

2) they promised never to give him a gun

"But that‚Äôs not what you said. We were talking about the span of time between Toy Story and TS4. Not how long Andy has had Woody. Woody is a toy from the 50‚Äôs, so by that logic, he‚Äôs almost 70 years old. But that wasn‚Äôt what we were talking about."

"I absolutely heard this and I love it, thank you."
So frozen is in the same universe.
‚ÄúUhh duhhh herrerrr eh derrrr‚Äù -that rock probably
I played with mud pies.
So my penis could talk? It's sentient?
So THAT‚ÄôS why people say dicks have a mind of their own
Hahahahahaha. This guy.^^^ Thanks! Needed that
My aunt played with rocks when I was a kid. She used to put them in a pipe and smoke them
"You were the lucky ones. We dreamed of one day having rocks to play with, all we had to was broken glass and our own tears"
I wonder if they become sentient after being created to be a plaything. Rocks you didn't make.
And now we have steven universe thanks to you. Lol
"Not totally voiceless. We only hear one Benson make a noise at all, but one does whisper something into Gabby Gabby's ear.

Source: saw TS4 twice in the theatre in a three day span."
"My guess is that its not about being a ""toy"" but rather having a personality ascribed to you. Therefore anything from pet rocks, statues, to your Roomba that you gave a nickname to could be sentient."
That's just demons
"Well yes, but actually no.  Have you even seen Night at the Museum?"
"I always think about Jessie lying under the bed for like 5-10 years. It's shown that she doesn't ever get up and she actually collects dust.

So my theory is that a toy can sort of ""shut off"" it's consciousness when it wants. Just goes lifeless until they want, or until someone interacts with them. 

How else would the toys keep from going insane for eternity?? What about toys forgotten in toyboxes orrr buried in landfills?"
"Yeah, like the bubble blower should have been sentient..."
Well they'd still be considered toys by most so I think they would remain alive
Needs a face? All of Andy's toys have faces iirc
Wreck it Ralph could take place in the same universe?
I mean.. Cars is a Pixar movie about sentient cars
"So are Sid's toys not one sentient being, but controlled each by their various parts?

Oh dear..."
"When Woody lost his arm in 2 he wasn't able to control it independently, so me potato Head is different"
Listen.... I don't know.
"*Now that Bonnie is through with me*

*That there is not much left of me*

so many disturbing questions
"since ceramic toys can move as if they weren't, the spork part would still be able to move."
"Dude, it's a movie."
That went dark af
No. My kids grew out of them so we gave them away to Sally Ann or maybe to a friend.
Well he did get a complete makeover in toy story 2.
Not that unusual for a toy with a voice box.
Count on it happening eventually.
Oh great we get to see Andy Sr. Give Andy Jr. Woody on his death bed to really tug at the heart strings.
"In toy story 2 the guy gets him into museum shape to sell. 

So it‚Äôs not been decades of no fading."
"I‚Äôm still wanting to believe that Andy‚Äôs mom was the girl who owned Jessie in the second movie, and she gave her Woody doll to Andy. It‚Äôd also explain the hat Andy has"
Then explain all the buzz lightyears that were sentient
But what about stinky Pete?
Gabby Gabby would disprove this in Toy Story 4.  Yet Forky would corroborate it.
What about the Key and Peele toys in TS4? Or the second Buzz in Toy Story 2 that is fresh out of the packet?
well considering Forky...it makes sense toys don't just come to life they need a kid to imbue them with it.
what about Prospector?
Sorry but doesn‚Äôt jive with the storyline in TS4 and the doll in that movie (don‚Äôt want to put any spoilers out there)
I didnt say woody wasnt alive before he found a kid. Maybe he just doesn't remember that time well since nothing really happened then
"The last two movies went really deep. For instance, in the third one, they confronted and accepted an inevitable death. It's insane how they manage to keep it light enough for kids, yet tear at the heartstrings of adult viewers. Those movies deal with such serious subject matter. I honestly don't remember much about the 2nd one. But I rewatched the third with my dad, who'd never seen it before we saw the fourth with my sister and BIL. We were both wiping away tears at the scene when they were in the incinerator at the dump.  And the next day we were all discreetly swiping away tears in the theater. 

And the first time I tried to watch UP, I had to stop after that first scene.  It was too much for me. I'm becoming a real softy as I age."
Toy Story 4 went way deeper than I expected. I thought I was just going to the movies with my niece not getting my heart wrenched out by Pixar. Seriously it was a great movie: better than most movies made for adults in the last couple years
My son graduated this year and my parents sold my childhood home. I felt this in my soul.
It's a cloth wound!
It's a flesh wound.
*I ain't got twine to bleed*
"No, it wasn't!"
"I dunno, I liked Toy Story 4 because it was different, and the villian wasn't really a villian, she was just this crazy obsessed doll who wanted to be loved. I do think the ending was bullshit, and Woody was just tossed aside even after Andy told Bonnie to take care of him."
*squeeks in shark*
"Toy = 16 cm

Human = 1.7 m

1829 m (Runway) > 396.633 m (Marathon for Toy)

"They never tell us when the movies take place.

We know Jessy live with Emily in the 70's, Syd look like a 90's kid and Internet chatrooms are a thing during Toy Story 3 (I don't think they use smartphones in 3, only classic cellphones) in a short Bonnie play a weird video games console at a friend's house (with VR or AR goggles)"

They probably started a band.
Fantastic answer
"Yeah, I have seen it. That is one possibility, which I think is more probabilistic. But it would be darker turn if it indeed makes them not alive as they are not considered as toys"
That would explain why Al's toy barn only ever had toys wandering around when their box was knocked over
"> How else would the toys keep from going insane 

Did you not see Lots-O from Toy Story 3? He was crazy"
What about those teddy bears that were stuck on the garbage truck in Toy Story 3
"For your last question, ICP's ""Play with me"" might hold some answers."
Maybe the magic is in the imagination of children and being played with is their life force.
"I don't think so. You recognize something as a toy because you recognize how you play with it. Buzz is a toy because it instigates make belief/storytelling. Mr. Potato Head is a toy that you play BY rearranging his limbs, so in a way, the limbs are the same toy. I think once Sid makes a frankentoy, that Frankentoy is recognized as a new, specific, single toy."
it would add to their mutant vibe
Is it possible that Woody can't use his arm because it's a small damaged part of a larger piece? He is pretty much 1 piece while Forky is very distinct pieces. If Forky were to pull on his entire arm as 1 single piece he may have abilities similar to Potato Head. And as some other have said it may also be affected by the way their kid plays with them.

It's not unusual to be loved by anyone.
"I think Woody would've recognized Jessie in that case. I'm definitely in the Andy's Mom=Jessie's Emily camp, but I think Woody is a family heirloom on Andy's dad's side."
Why would she drop off Jessie in a box and keep Woody?
maybe Emily and Andy's Dad bonded over mutual nostalgia for Woody's Roundup
This theory works except for in toy story 2 when the second buzz lightyear captures Buzz. Could possibly be a return I guess.
"Kids toy store lol, all the kids grabbing to check the box etc I guess"
The Asian kids that made them played with them a bit during manufacturing.
Damn. Good one.
"but forky was never made to be a toy, he was just a fork and some craft materials. gabby gabby was made to be a toy, thus making her sentient ^idklol"
The Asian kids that made them played with them a bit during manufacturing.
Then explain Gabby Gabby
"See this is why I don't get why people don't like 3!!  I understand if you grew up with them and didn't like the idea of a new on trampling on your childhood but I just can't agree it did that.  As someone who came at all of them around the same time (I had a....restrictive childhood), they are all great in their own way.  


Personally I love how long it took to make 3 and 4.  It really felt like they waited until they had a story to tell.  And the stories they told were such good, deep stories that the oldest and youngest of us can enjoy, and that has always been Pixar's mark.  They've had some odd missteps but I can't agree Toy Story are any of them, and I'm so glad they still have it."

"I agree.  My theory for the spacing of the sequels was to reach different generations. The first two came out when I was still a kid. Their subject matter wasn't too deep, but still weren't exactly shallow kids movies with no message.
The last two came out when I was an adult, and had much darker themes, which they successfully made light-hearted enough to go over most kids' heads. All the adults that grew up with the first 2 were starting to have kids of their own (or not).  But adults and children alike were all able to get down with Toy Story yet again.  
They were far enough apart to grab multiple generations.  And because they were so far apart, they managed to stay fresh and relevant.

My rating of favorite to less favorite = 3,1,4,2"
"The originals are probably dead but as seen with Forky, toys can just be made so the frankentoys aren't necessarily the stitched together souls of the sources of their parts, but their own unique new beings

it does raise the question though, if the frankentoys were disassembled and put back together in their original bodies, would those be new toys or would the previous individual minds return to their bodies?"
Fuck I wanted this

"I'll have to check that out, thanks!"
I've tried but there is always streaking left sadly
Jessie was given away by Emily as she got older.
"Thats really interesting because it would mean they really are looking at parents who soon enough will need to let go of their role as a parent, as well as other instances of that kinda concept for other people as adults.

I don't think I can rate them.  I think I enjoyed 3 the most.  1 is just this honey classic.  2 is this great sequel to 1.  And 4 like.  It's weird.  I don't even think 4 was the most enjoyable of them.  3 I had a blast watching.  And yet, like, I can't stop thinking about 4 for some reason.  It's weird.  The last time I can remember something like that is when I watched Citizen Kane as a young teenager.  I remember thinking it was honestly pretty boring and yet I was glued to the screen the whole time.  And afterwards I just couldn't stop thinking about it."
"But also, those toys were in pain and wished for death, right? Well, definitely in a tortured state. Why would they be if they were just assembled from parts? I'd think they *are* fragmented souls, and so they suffer."
Toy of Theseus?
"I'm gonna go with when you fix a toy, it's fixed. Now here's a new question, by shopping at thrift stores I have fixed a toy by stealing parts off a broken Buzz Lightyear to make a complete working Buzz. And yes the donor was beyond help so I was confident Buzz is the kind of guy who checks ""yes"" for organ donor. I guess that makes dead toy dead and live toy the same toy with donor parts."
"Would it even be right/moral/ethical to essentially murder Frankentoy, who had no say in its own creation and is essentially an innocent, in order to try to return the former toys to life? The Captain Kathryn Janeway figurine on the shelf over there says yes."
"Yeah. I don‚Äôt want to spoil the new movie; but another repair in that one as well. But 60-70 years and no fading, worn-out spots, stains, scuffs, etc... he‚Äôs in amazing condition considering all the hijinks he gets himself into."

this all makes Sid's toys all the more a tragic horror concept
Sid is abusive to his toys in a lot of ways. He tries to blow up Buzz by tying him to a firework. It's not hard to imagine that they can no longer bear the pain of Sids abuse or losing friends to his machinations

"Here's an example of a person using a belief/movement/lifestyle/whatever to justify their shitty behavior.

Perpetuating negativity is a route you can take but it will only cause more suffering and then you're no better than the people that have oppressed you. The cycle of pain continues. Both genders need to forgive eachother, forgive themselves and promote positivity for love to truly thrive."
"...Well, at least she's up front about it. Someone else who gets a thrill out of cheating or simply doesn't like monogamy might like this quite a bit."
Imagine how she would react to her significant other cheating though.
"Quite certain she doesn‚Äôt understand words like feminism, empowerment and autonomy. IMO having the freedom to do something questionable and choosing not to is more empowering."
Novel idea. Don't enter into an 'exclusive' relationship in the first place. That's an idea which goes against centuries of oppression against women!

"Why ""cheat""? Why not let it be known that you're not interested in a monogamous relationship and let the other person make a decision about whether or not they want to deal with you? It's only ""cheating"" when you've convinced your partner that you're committed to an exclusive relationship."
Imagine being this gullible
That‚Äôs not how feminism works. Idiot.
"If he cheats though, men are pigs"
"Damn this is shitty. I mean if she goes in to relationships with this mind set, why not look for someone who is down for an open/ poly relationship?"
Fake bull. Pandering to angry men and to just get negative comments flowing.
Coming from one feminist: cheating doesn‚Äôt make you a feminist or woke. It makes you an asshole.
"As soon as he cheats, shes all like: ""Omg men are trash"""
"The bullshit rationalizations are strong in this one.

If she was really such an eMpoWeReD wOmAn, she'd admit that she just feels like sleeping with whoever she wants. She'd also be honest about it with her dude, and let him decide if he wants to be involved with all that, because being a strong feminist woman does not mean you have a license to hurt and take advantage of the men around you.

For shame. It's bitches like her that make feminists like me, who are truly *only* in pursuit of **EQUAL RIGHTS ACROSS GENDER**, look bad in the face of her shallow, stupid and selfish behavior. Gahh."
"This sounds a lot like a similar 4chan prank/stunt/whatever you want to call it. I'm sure there's a handful of people that think this way, but I doubt they cultivate an identity around it. I'd bet that this is fake."
If her boyfriend cheats on her I bet she‚Äôd get mad
All this 'she/her' bullshit on peoples profiles is so stupid. üôÑ
r/nicegirls
"Here‚Äôs an idea:
You could just choose to not be a piece of shit and be in an open relationship.
Be honest, seek people out who are into that lifestyle instead of being an attention seeking drama whore."
What a bitch. Definitely not the definition of Feminism.
"Woman: I can cheat on you if I want

Man: OK

Man: *cheats on cheating woman*

Woman: pikachu face"
this is your brain on feminism
Every day. We stray further from God.
Yes I have chlamydia. Having chlamydia is one of the most personal and empowering experiences a person can have with their own body. The secretions are my own. The puss is my own.
So she's a Hoe then. Poor fella trusting his misses and she's doing that regular.
"""PATRIARCHY!"""
I‚Äôd still hit it
"No I‚Äôm pretty sure cheating is just her being an asshole, not fighting oppression"
Is the picture her sucking some other dude off lol
This is probably the funniest excuse for ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a cheating whore‚Äù
is this my ex-fiance post college?
Whatever helps her cold hearted self sleep at night ........
"Society has chosen to suppress self autonomy in women. Go fuck yourself, honestly"
Sounds like such a guilty self-justification made in hindsight lmao
"‚ô™ *You lie, cheat and steal* ‚ô´  
‚ô´ *You lie, cheat and steal* ‚ô™   
‚ô™ *You lie, cheat and steal* ‚ô´  
‚ô´ *I cannot tolerate you* ‚ô™"
> self autonomy
I just threw up
It's too good to be real lol has to be a troll
If she felt like that she could just have on 1 night stands without being in a relationship. She just likes the feeling of hoi n behind someone's back and potentially hurting someone
Lmao imagine trying to justify your digusting behaviour with false feminism because your personality sucks so much that you can't even admit your whoring
So empowering when you give someone gonorrhea
Is this a porn blog? The photo at the bottom looks like it has nudeness.
I'm pretty sure that's not how feminism works
"As a cranky old lady who's been a feminist since long before this little twerp was born, I say: don't use feminism and having dominion over your own body as an excuse to cheat, because it's a really shitty one.  Linking ""feminism"" and one-sided cheating is a great way to to give the former a bad name, and yours truly, feminist since my teens in the '70s, does NOT appreciate it.  Unless you and your partner have already discussed the topic and are both OK with being non-exclusive sexually (which I wouldn't do, being monogamous by nature--isn't one person enough to deal with?--but whatever), the standard operating procedure in this culture, like it or not, is for sexual monogamy, which is probably what her boyfriend/husband thinks they have.  Not only are you breaking an implicit contract, but you're being an asshole as well, since he's most likely going to be devastated when (not if, when) he finds out you're fucking half the metro area.  Also, karma is a bitch, baby--almost invariably those who cheat eventually get cheated on, and then where will you be?"
"So she doesn't want to be in a relationship then.

What she described as ""empowering"" is really just whoring around.

Can call an apple an orange, but that still doesn't change what it actually is. 

Cheating is what you do when you're insecure with yourself and lack any sort of integrity. Let's be real."
Jesus these fucking people. Just find another ethically non monogamous partner. It's 2019.
"What bothers me is I know she won't change her mind, people who are that delusional can't be convinced"
"Right, because monogamy benefits men, not women. ü§£"
And he has every right to roll the fuck out and go no contact when he catches you.
Why even bother with a relationship? Because you want a stable backup...
I hope this is a satire.
Theres actually people like this walking around??
Imagine being a stupid bitch and using feminism to justify shitty behaviour
yes tell her to cheat more in saudi arabia see what happens
"could be a troll account, hopefully."
"So if a guy does it, it's being unfaithful, but if a woman does it, it's subversion?

Something doesn't seem right here..."
I already know what kind of crazy I'm dealing with when someone starts off by listing their preferred pronouns.
Until she... ya know... let‚Äôs another person control her body for a night.
So she gets into a relationship basically knows and understands that by being in that relashionship she has agreed to commitment then decides to call that oppression?  Gosh I hope she ends up getting cheated on directly in front of her just so she feels and understands what she really is doing to others.
"Wouldn‚Äôt it be funny if her boyfriend was a cheater? Oh the karma...

The sad thing is, I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôd learn anything except dive further into feeling like some victim of the world who‚Äôs owed special privileges."
something seems off here
This is very clearly bait. How do people fall for this stuff?

Being an asshole is not empowering. Relationships have rules
"""Yes I get StD's often"""
"Sorry I need to add my views about this otherwise il lose it and I don‚Äôt care if anyone see this (I do care) but I need to say something. 

Firstly my deep apologies to the main guy who had to put up with a whore who can‚Äôt help it but use her body on others than her boyfriend. 

My name is sunny and I‚Äôm a male, I respect everyone and I use my manners. I am loyal to those around me. A message to this bitch (who may not read this but il say anyway) you have control of your body and yes you get to do what you want BUT his is his business because you broken one of the most biggest relationship guide ever, Trust. It don‚Äôt have the right to treat this guy and to any men like that ever. I don‚Äôt care if you a feminist or even a person but for fuck sake have some fucking dignity and stick with one person! I have met other people who says that their boyfriend and girlfriend cheated them and of course I have to say to keep putting head up and you will find the right person but to this girl, I honestly hope you realise that what you have done has caused misery and treachery to this gentleman! I fucking hope this girl realise that she have done it and change her habit because I swear, she will have karma right into her face. 

Lesson to learn: live and love your partner, talk to them, cherish them but what ever you do DONT FUCKING CHEAT ON THEM!

*cough*

Ok I‚Äôm done now, sorry if didn‚Äôt make sense I just had to get my anger out anyway have a good day everyone!

Sunny

P.S can I get a amen in the chat please? Thanks!"
Eew this is so gross. What is her number so I can text her how bad it is?
I can only hope she gets an STD
That is Tumblr. There are many blog bios that read similar because it‚Äôs a ‚Äòkink‚Äô and they role play with other users. Definitely not real.
"her bf should fuck whoever shes cheating with in front of her and see how she likes it

its not gay if they keep their socks on and say no homo"
"Ah, in order to be in control of your body, you just become a whore"
None of his business until he catches herpes from your nasty ass.
"Wonder what she'd say if he reveals that he's 'controlling' his body, too"
She's empowered yet she's afraid to tell him
"Its not really cheating then now is it? It's just friends with benefits, or screwing around."
"Continued:

Hope her boyfriend is fucking numerous other women and she finds out and gets mad.
Bitch you can cheat just dont expect the rest of us to support your decision.
Just have an open relationship with someone who's interested in the same thing. No need to be shitty and hurt someone who would rather be in a committed monogamous relationship.
Omg feminism has got to stop being an excuse to be an asshole. I'm a feminist and this kills me.
"Can anyone explain how ""he doesn't know"" when she has this in a public website?"
Can I get a THOT in the chat.
"Or you could live an honest life and date until you find someone whose okay with you hooking up with other people? Those people ARE out there, and there is nothing like living a life true to yourself and everyone out there. It sounds like you‚Äôre just putting unnecessary stress on yourself by having to keep up with all the lies you tell."
Holy shit is this my ex???
BuT iTs HeR bOdy No OnE cOnTroLs iT!
Or you could choose to be in an ethically non-monogomous relationship instead of cheating willy nilly and actually communicate your needs to your partner.
"IKR? Feminism is about seeking respect, autonomy, and equal rights for *all* people. Guess what? That person being cheated on has just as much of a right to want a monogamous relationship as much as you have a right to want an open one. You don‚Äôt have a right to that person, and if their desires aren‚Äôt in line with yours you don‚Äôt have a right to deceive them. Feminism isn‚Äôt a blanket for you to hide behind so you don‚Äôt have to act with integrity. Feminism doesn‚Äôt give you the ok to lie and break another person‚Äôs trust because you knew deceiving them was the only way you could have sex with them and keep them around.

EDIT: Hi r/MensRights. Nice to see your members totally aren‚Äôt brigading posts that were shared on your subreddit, or spamming people for making the tragic mistake of pointing out that most feminists‚Äîwho aren‚Äôt high schoolers on Tumblr‚Äîaren‚Äôt going to support abhorrent behavior and actually care about intersectionality. Whoops, my bad."
"Wow there you fascist, commitment is the tool of the patriarchy to slave women!!"
"Exactly. 

Just be single.  Don't be about that slime life.

I'm a woman and I can say for sure if you flip the script, and replace that with man, people would want blood."

All I could think of [was this](https://i.imgur.com/wYqMi4w.gif) the whole time I was reading this post.
"Or you could be upfront and open about it so they can make safe sexual decisions, AND you can control your body. You can go against the patriarchy, AND be ethical about your non-monogomy."
"Actually the real alternative here is be in a functional open relationship. I'm all about sexual liberties with consenting parties. If she can find a man who is willing to have an open relationship with her, with both being able to benefit from it, then it removes the cheating."
"2019 - well yes but no
2018 - that‚Äôs where you‚Äôre wrong

"Of course it's oppressive- you're giving up your right to other people, but it's in pursuit of something better. Just because you call it ""oppression"" or ""taking your freedom"" doesn't mean it's bad. We're all committed if it's the right person."
BuT If He ChEaTs Me He Is The PiecE oF Shit
"Honestly so many people these days don't see it as such. Nobody wants to commit or sacrifice for each other. Everyone wants to do whatever the fuck they want and if your partner doesn't like it ""that's their problem cause they have to accept me for who I am!"". Or some bullshit. If you ever have a fight or a marital issue, don't ever tell your young friends cause their only answer will just be ""well since you're not happy right now, break up with them!""."
...what heart?
"Well that‚Äôs sexist and oppressive patriarchy, obviously. 

Seriously, people like this are so self centered. I really hope her partner finds this tumblr and figures out who it is so they can dump her ass."
"They‚Äôd probably follow up with the whole nonsense of ‚Äúif I cheat it‚Äôs okay, because the man couldn‚Äôt keep me happy. If he cheats, then he is a garbage human.‚Äù I am sick of seeing that kind of bullshit."
Cheaters already have to deal with the fact that by the time they hit 40-45 they will be single and they would have never understood how to hold a valuable stable relationship. These people will likely go through troublesome break one after another never finding happiness in any one person. Their life will flash by with only themselves in the frame.
"""Ugh all men are pigs and can't be trusted! OMG why can't I find a good man!""

In reality this is the type of girl that will get caught and then try to ruin the life of her ex as revenge for leaving her.
"She‚Äôs never going to have a normal relationship, she will cheat. On every. Single. Person. She ever has a relationship with"
I doubt she has the capacity to care enough about someone else to actually be hurt by them like that. She turned off those emotions long ago.
She'll find a way to make herself the victim.
"I hope she sees the error in her ways and changes her ways and attitudes and lives a long happy life and stops hurting other people.

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"you kidding me? she'll just use it as proof that men are evil and deserve being cheated on, and its an example of the ~oppression~. These sorts of narcissistic abusive women never get better from having the same thing happen to them, they ALWAYS play the victim."
100% agree
I'll bet $100 that ONLY SHE is allowed to cheat and her bf isn't allowed to even look at other women.
"Yeah she‚Äôs rationalizing it. Doesn‚Äôt mean it makes sense, but it does to her so she doesn‚Äôt have to feel bad."
"This completely. I see it a lot in the NYC dance music scene when young and naive people randomly switch to being poly and go off the rails in the first 6 months. I‚Äôve seen people, both men and women, full on wreck marriages over this shit just because they want to do whatever they want instead of taking the proper care to explore being poly in a healthy manner. It‚Äôs always those that go open and then slip up and fuck some rando and don‚Äôt tell their partner and then do it again and again that this happens to that it‚Äôs become a full blown cliche."
"Not only that, but it really isn't that hard to flip this into something totally ethical and honest.

Basically just poly but you agree not to discuss each other's other partners. It's not even a particularly rare arrangement."
"I offered my then-husband an open relationship and was genuinely happy about the possibility. We'd had enough threesomes that I knew jealousy wasn't my thing, as long as I got him at the end of the day. I read books, had conversations, negotiated boundaries. I told him months before I got involved with someone else, and I ended up literally dragging the poor third party back to his hotel room. He'd been nervous and had one too many to drink. It was hilarious and life-affirming and eventually I caught him sober.

My piece of shit ex nevertheless managed to cheat with double-digits of folks, sometimes raw-dogging chlamydiac strangers in darkened car parks.

There is some stupidity which knows no bounds."
Seriously. Yep it *is* your body but being in any kind of relationship entails certain responsibilities and expectations. Fuck this bitch.
"I don't see it as trashy at all really just selfish. If you wanna fuck lotsa dudes with no strings attached then knock yourself out, just be up front about it"

"It's a tumblr. Usually anonymous, probably fake."
Pretty sure it‚Äôs a pussy.

Probably just an incel that made a fake account.
"Super crap, mega crap."
"She knows, and is trying to justify it"
That's because it's an Incel/MGTOW false flag
It fits the Incel Worldview that feminism is training women to cuck men for Chad too perfectly. Of course it's a troll.
"I don't think its a troll, I think its a fetish blog"
"Exactly, especially given how many people hate feminism."
"Real life is so outrageous nowadays, I'm usually 50/50 whether these posts are trolls or not"
"Yeah, seems almost custom made for one of those empowered men subs that just bashes women, but it's fine caus they have an article that this woman once did something bad."
"I‚Äôve met multiple people like this irl. Like exactly this. Shitty would be an understatement. They‚Äôre usually the same kind of people that make a huge show of their alliance with a particular group or political movement, and then try to hide behind that to excuse their shittiness instead of trying to act with any sort of integrity.

Feminism isn‚Äôt about the right to deceive others. It‚Äôs about the right to autonomy, respect, and equal rights‚Äîfor yourself *and* others. If you don‚Äôt want to be in a monogamous relationship, *then don‚Äôt fucking be in one*. But don‚Äôt deceive your partner by agreeing to a committed relationship, and then intentionally act in a way you know will hurt them. That‚Äôs just being a garbage person, and it‚Äôs made even worse by the fact that they‚Äôre dragging a social movement through the mud to try and justify it."
"yeah, really, imagine being this gullible. or uh, eager to hate women."
its a PORN BLOG
"Honestly sounds like a kink thing to me. I have enough friends involved in sex work to know that ""nonconsensual"" cuckolding is a huge kink. I would be shocked if this was an actual woman and not just some guy getting his rocks off.

Edit: hell, even my partner has wanted to role play this kind of thing. He would be crushed if it happened, but people are strange with their fantasies."
dear lord i hope so
When her pussy tastes like my brother's dick I think it's some of my business.
Any ideology really do be like that
its a porn blog. for fetishes. has nothing to do with feminism
"Highly likely it's just a troll account created by an incel to discredit feminism/women. It's high effort bait, and it's working."

how to:  confuse people about feminists 101
I always love seeing people trying to justify cheating by saying monogamy is almost nonexistent in nature. But they fail to realize they we‚Äôre no longer wild animals out in the jungle we‚Äôre supposed to be civilized animals with some sort of self restraint not to murder and fuck everything that moves.

"I‚Äôm very, very, *very* convinced that if this isn‚Äôt bait, it‚Äôs a fetish blog, hence the black and white soft porn u can see in the pic."
Exactly! I just said the same thing. I can see a guy posing as a female and posting that.
"This is most likely a high effort bait post by a bitter incel who wants to try to stoke anti-sjw/anti- feminist resentment. And hey, it looks like it might be working if your conclusion here is ""feminism bad"".

It's trivially easy to create or doctor some social media post to say ""As a feminist...I hate men, want to abolish gender, but also be treated like a princess because women have been oppressed for centuries. Donate to my patreon, I'm on a mission to censor every sexist video game in existence. Again, I say this \*as a feminist\*. WOMEN RULE.""

Use your Internet noggin to determine if that's likely bait or not."
Troll posts on tumblr are the reason? Wow interesting!
Because redditors are all too eager to eat up a troll post?
"The kind of people that try to hide behind social movements to justify their shittiness like this lack the integrity to care about how their actions might impact that social movement and it‚Äôs perception by society at large. 

I‚Äôm a feminist, and I‚Äôve met a decent amount of people irl who do exactly this and then try to hide behind ~feminism~. Like, your right to autonomy does not equate to a right to knowingly hurt others. If you meet someone who wants a monogamous relationship, feminism does not give you the right to deceive them so that you‚Äôll be able to sleep with them. If anything, it‚Äôs the exact opposite... then these same shitty people go all *shocked pikachu face* when movements like TRP and MRA pick up on people like themselves using feminism as a blanket for their shittiness and use it as a mark against feminism ‚Äî like, what the fuck did you think would happen?"
"Yeah feminism isn‚Äôt inherently bad, it‚Äôs just the loud minority of toxic feminists represent the whole group"

I mean racism and sexism maybe?
Oh and don‚Äôt forget the lovely #killallmen that they have been using recently.
Because that means she would have to share too
"I mean if she really was a proud ""feminist"" she wouldn't hide this from her partner. If she doesn't feel guilty for what she does why hide it from him?"

"Rules for thee, but not for me..."
Jokes on her she now no longer controls her body due to that statement.
"""I'm grown up and don't like being told what to do!""

""I just asked if you could help with the dishes, Karen"""
"Yeah she doesn't control it either, she just let's it do what it wants"
"I know this is a joke reply but..if it was her saying this I'd have to ask the question...isn't she controlling her ""s""/o's body while doing this???"
I mean that means he can cheat too by the same logic?
"Yes she does, and she can CHOOSE not to cheat as well, free will works both ways"
I mean she controls her body but the guys she‚Äôs cheating with controls her mind
I choose to celebrate my right to control my body by kicking homeless people.
Here take my poor mans ü•áüéñüèÖ
What I‚Äôm hearing is that she doesn‚Äôt control her own body either.
"Then she should be a in an open relationship. But, oh wait, then *he* would sleep with other people, and of course she wants to have control of his body while denying him control of hers, because of oppression."
"Right? Lol 

If you want an open relationship go for it, as long as both of you are ok with it."
What? Relationships thrive off of individual freedom and hiding things from your partner. It's not about agreeing on a shared lifestyle and making compromises to make both of your lives happier and better.
You sound an awful lot like you are trying to control her body. It's her body she can decide that the whole thing is one big asshole if she wants to be shitty
"I get that laws won‚Äôt stop you from cheating, but luckily society frowns on it. If you cheat you aren‚Äôt showing anything other than you‚Äôre a dick."
"The kicker is I'll bet she doesn't want an open relationship, that's why she says it's none of his business. Guaranteed if he ever cheats on her, it's the end of the world. She's just selfish."
These collective identity theories start to breakdown really quickly when people try to punish an individual for the historical wrongs of a group.
"It's not complicated, she's just trying to justify her shitty behavior"
Why do you think that is what feminism is ?  Feminism is about gaining more power and influence for women. That is all .
That is so 1900. Feminism is about doing whatever you want and trying to absolve yourself of the consequences in 2019.
"Feminism and what these people think is feminism are so far from being the same thing it ain't even in the same stratosphere. What they want isn't equality for all people, regardless of gender (and, ideally, race and all that), but rather a card for them to play to get away with doing what they want in the name of feminism, or in this case, ""female empowerment""."
"Feminism was about that, yes."
it doesn't appear to me like she wants an open relationship. She just wants to be able to cheat on her partner and her partner be monogamous.
This person probably suffered some trauma. I dated a girl who was raped in college and she cheated on me twice. Both times she chalked it up to basically the same logic this person is using. She wanted the stability of a monogamous relationship but felt that it was too controlling and the only way she felt in control of her body was to drunkenly hook up with whatever random dude was hitting on her at the bar she worked at. I hope she got the help she needs. I haven‚Äôt heard from her in last ten years.
Yeah! It‚Äôs not like they have a choice in whether to commi- oh wait...
I know what are they hilter or something.
"I think the reaction is pretty even-handed honestly, if you take away the ""I do this because I'm a feminist"" bullshit. Most people, even people who are REALLY into social justice, are against cheating and dislike cheaters both because of morality and out of self-interest."
If she was single she wouldn't be getting the emotional and possibly financial support that her boyfriend gives her. She'd rather use him for what she wants from him and then go and fuck other people because it's clearly all about her. Why would she consider the feelings of another if other people are there to simply satisfy her wants?
"Yes, but we can agree this situation is trashy, if you go behind your partners back without talking about it"
....... Excellent point.
"Yeah, I was going to say that. They would see being cheated on as a reason to hate that type of person and how society let's that happen to them. It's the whole world conspiring against them."
Plot twist: there is no partner. There never was.
Serious insight from u/_DickSwizzler_
I'd hope he cheat on her instead
"Anyway we (reddit) together can help with that? If she is currently with a partner, I'd feel like they should know."
My brother's ex-wife. Serial cheater. She's now pushing 40 and starting to panic because she's alone and has to compete with girls on their 20's for men that will only deal with her emotional baggage for 2 or 3 months at a time. Every relationship she has ends in a fucking trainwreck.
Go to any shitty bar in your town. They are there. Still trying to act like they are 20.
"Yet, I will probably hit my 40 AND Be single without having cheating anyone"
Imagine needing someone to be happy.
Only until she meets someone that she falls madly in love with. Hopefully that person will cheat on her
You're a far better person than I am.
I concur! Also suggest she has crabs with a sprinkle of the herp.
"well duh, looking at other women would just be further opressing her

she has to cheat to get even as it is"
"Well, yeah. Then it would be an open relationship, which would mean it's not cheating. Can't have that, because of oppression."
She still likely feels some level of guilt that's why she's rationalizing.
Polyamory is a ton of work. Worth it (for me) but fuuuuck. You talk about your feelings a lot. Many people don't want to do that work and those people shouldn't be poly
"Yup. He is also a piece of shit and I‚Äôm sincerely sorry. 

Cheating is cheating if anyone plays outside the rules and it genuinely sucks. :("
"Narcissism.  You can give the narcissist options to be honest and transparent but they thrive on doing shit behind your back, they thrive on dishonesty and disrespect."
Not being upfront about it _is_ the trashy part
"But she‚Äôs not being up front about it. 

That‚Äôs specifically the trashy part."
"I think it's most likely a fetish thing. At least when tumblr had porn on it there were a lot of people playing a character like this.

Or it's just bait so someone can laugh at tumblr rage. I'd need to look at the blog to decide, but I really don't wanna go on tumblr."
"It does sound fake. 
Until verified true I shall take it as such."
Yeah....poes law anyone?
Can confirm.
Nothing says empowerment like getting throat fucked
Tumblr has porn again?
"It absolutely is. I just found the account on Tumblr. It's full of porn of naked or half-naked women (like NO men or dicks), references to having a sexual desire to submit to men, and nonsense replies to people calling them out. I was willing to suspend disbelief that this could be a real person, but everything on their Tumblr fits with it being fake. For example:

>>I mean polyamerous but you're partner knows what is occurring, when he/she is alright that you have full control over who you want to sleep with yourself

>Yes, I would if the situation arose. What I would not do is enter a cuckold situation where he got off on the idea or wanted to watch or anything like that. **Sorry, I don't like weak men, not attracted to betas.**"
"Seriously. This is more than likely the case. People are more than willing to jump on the ""dumb whore bitch feminazi"" groupthink train."

Lol everyone loves to call shit a false flag. You have no way of knowing that.
"Her attitude in this strikes me as someone who would try to justify any man doing wrong to her as rape, if she felt betrayed enough. This isn't about cheating, this is about justifying any way to get what she wants... like someone who has to win at any cost."
Either way it‚Äôs fake.

It‚Äôs a fetish page
IDK how Reddit is so gullible it's being fooled by a fetish blog.
"Oh, explains a lot XD"
"A lot of insane stuff online is just non-tagged roleplaying that people fall for, like the incest subreddit where people post all these ""real confessions"" where OP is a hot milf teaching her teenage son all about sex.

It's kind of worrying how many people fall for it, seems like people would believe in bonsai cats if it was posted in a DIY subreddit."
"Oh, I didn't know that, thanks for the info! And yeah, some kinks are really strange, but whatever get's you off, right?"

You right.
Sometime it be like that.
"I was going to add ‚Äúimagine being fooled by an obvious 4chan troll‚Äù.

Then scrolled past metres and metres of people who **wanted** to be fooled"
That wasn‚Äôt really explained in the post. I was just calling is as I saw it. I never really saw cheating as a fetish though.

She is if she brings him a nice bouquet of STDs.
"No, HIM cheating would be anti-feminist. Duh."
"Lmao...logic doesn't apply here so no. She gets to cheat,not him. Don't get it twisted."
"My ex thought this.  It‚Äôs a big ol‚Äô NO.  She HAD to have more than one person to meet her needs.  Meanwhile I had to be completely satisfied only with her.  That was the difference, she NEEDED it so it was valid, I WANTED it so it wasn‚Äôt valid.  To a point where she would get mad at ANY interaction I had with another woman but I had to be cool with her finding other men because she was just doing what she needed."
Oh ho ho ho!
"She's empowering herself, and her shit to get *yeet* out onto the lawn."
"That seems presumptuous. Just because she fucks them doesn't mean she's emotionally involved, she sounds like a narcissist"
Exactly! There's options for this that don't include cheating on your partner.
Ha I was going to say OP is a walking contradiction.  You literally can't cheat if you're upfront about it
"Social pressure is often way more effective than legal pressure. I mean, look at the logical hoops that person has to jump through to try justify herself to people socially so she doesn‚Äôt have to feel guilt for being a bad person"
"I just don‚Äôt get the rationale here. Like, if you don‚Äôt believe in monogamy then say that to people, and refuse to be in a monogamous relationship. It‚Äôs that simple. It makes me angry, because I‚Äôve seen it irl. I used to be more into the bar scene, and I had a lot of shitty people that ended up in my social circle because of it. I‚Äôve known a good amount of people who do exactly this‚Äîthey cheat on their partners and later say it‚Äôs ok because ~feminism~‚Äîlike full out instagram posts justifying it and everything. No. No, feminism does not say it‚Äôs ok to knowingly deceive another person because you know that‚Äôs the only way they‚Äôll sleep with you. As a feminist it makes me legitimately angry when people try to pull this bs."
"Depending on where you live, they totally can. Seriously adultery is still illegal in some jurisdictions in the US."
And that you love dick lol
"Nah it's more of:
 Don't do something that you don't want done to you.

I call it common sense. 
 
No one likes being cheated on or lied to.
Not to mention once discovered that person will never trust you again. 
Trust is easy to lose, hard to get back."
"Yes, but he hasn't been oppressed. Unless he's got some minority racial heritage in his ancestry, in which case it's fine for him to cheat on her. Of course."
"My ex-husband had a Tinder account he was using to cheat on me. Guess what his excuse was? What made it worse was finding out that he was not only being cheered on by a mutual friend, but that she had helped him set the account up, and one of the pictures she‚Äôd helped him pick out was of the two of them drinking together *during our fucking wedding*. She‚Äôd been part of our bridal party. Like, not only was he using Tinder to cheat on me, and not only was one of our former bridesmaids encouraging him to, but they‚Äôd set up a profile together and used our wedding pictures for the damn profile. She was also cheating on her SO, and I think she wanted a cheating buddy. They used this exact excuse."

Cognitive dissonance can drive people to make the most insane rationalizations.
Yup. I explored it a bit earlier this year and one party was pulling this shit I outlined above and it drove me up a wall. These are the types that are too afraid to come to the realization that they don‚Äôt actually love anyone because they don‚Äôt know what love is and confuse it with infatuation and then suddenly they‚Äôre in 3 ‚Äúrelationships‚Äù to try to fill a massive internal void instead of approaching their problems in a healthy manner. Instead it just causes selfishness and problems.
"its fucking hard enough to be open with my feelings to ONE person that I'm in a relationship with, let alone MULTIPLE people?? You'd have to be some kind of emotional juggernaut to be able to handle that. Nope, I'll stick with my poor attempts at monogamy, thanks. But all the power to ya if you can handle it."
"Agreed, I used to know someone with this fetish. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è"

"Yeah, this seems like obvious antifeminist bait."
"Redditors are so fucking bad at spotting fakes that it hurts. Every single day there's tons of fake shit like this on the front page, it's depressing. ""Feminist bad, I upvote!"""
"Pretty much what I was thinking, way too on the nose. Plus, when you are cheating, you generally don't announce it to the world."

No one uses the word beta to refer to humans unless they're a goddamn incel!!!!!
"I call it ""rage bait"". I've been seeing it a lot recently."
Forreal. Even if you prove this is 100 percent fake they claim they know people just like this so it doesn't matter if it's not real this time.
How is Rush Limbaugh supposed to keep bringing up tumblr lunatics if his interns aren't manufacturing content for him?
"i spent a LOT of time on tumblr as a teenager. that blog has the default appearance settings and the bio is entirely in the description of the blog (as opposed to being on another page, which is how 95% of active tumblr users do it). i can't say that those things definitely make it fake, and there is a shit ton of crazy on that site, but to me it looks like someone who hasn't used the platform before making a low effort troll blog. plus it's too on-the-nose and obvious. ""it's okay if i cheat becuz the patriarchy!!1!!!! i love feminizm!1!1!1"" even if you had those beliefs, why would you put it all in the description?"
"And you have no way of knowing it's real. But we can examine the likelihood of it being authentic, and this just doesn't cut it. There isn't even a picture of the supposed ""feminist""."
It means the side they support is magically no longer culpable! ‚ÄúIt was that other group! The one I don‚Äôt like!‚Äù

"We've been Scarlet-lettering a neighbor that cheated on my friend who is young and has a 6 mo baby with him. 

He's back now, and they're trying to work it out. I've been starting to feel bad and petty for ignoring and mean-mugging him,  but I feel he disrespected my sweet friend and abandoned their baby.

So you're right, societal pressure may help him learn."
[We live in a society](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contractualism)
Ya like if you wanna have multiple partners then enter into a relationship where all of you are consenting to that from the beginning. Monogamy isn't someone controlling you it's TRUST THAT YOU SAID YOU WANT 1 PARTNER AND WILL DO THAT. If you don't want one partner just be honest !!!
"Pretty sure this is just misandry. If she was was a Lesbian she wouldn't be writing shit like that, it's specifically because it's directed towards men."

A lot little steps & a year later I looked back and thought ‚ÄúHow the fuck did I get here?‚Äù  So then it was several months of trying to pry her out of my life & when I finally had no reason to talk to her any more, & moved 100+ miles away, she slapped me with a restraining order & drug it through the courts for several more months.

"I was on the other end of one of these situations with someone I had been off and on friends with for a while.

It was a girl who was in some kind of toxic, quasi open relationship where they were both in a perpetual revenge cheating cycle. Of course, I had no idea she was with somebody at first-it was when he actually started showing up that it became apparent that they weren't as over as she led me to believe.

It's like at first they kept breaking up over cheating, then they decided that they didn't want to break up but that they couldn't keep their individual undies on more than 10 minutes outside of each other's presence.

I don't even know why I kept showing up outside of convenience and wanting to get laid. We'd go out, I'd hear her bitch about him being out with someone else, I'd stay over at her place until he showed up later that night.

The weird thing is that he obviously didn't like me but he was never hostile or openly angry about it. It was just offputting and awkward. One time him and the girl he was banging met up with me and her at a bar we hung out at. He even bought my drinks that night. 

Finally, I decided that it got too weird when I noticed a text pop up on her phone grilling her about being out with me. He ended it with a promise to eat her out after I was done.

I noped the fuck out."
"Public shaming is also weak. You really did the right thing. Although, you shouldn't hesitate to tell anyone who asks you about it."

I wanted to post it on media too but I just couldn‚Äôt, well every one at work found out and that was so harsh I actually felt bad for her when I shouldn‚Äôt have. 

Picking the high road was definitely best, and it sucks ass but eventually you will be ok."

As far as federal government goes, only 11% feel the federal government does the right thing most of the time, and 72% feel like federal agencies use their power to influence voters.

"Yeah, you see that a lot on /r/niceguys

But this post is specifically trying to imply that women‚Äôs rights and the pro-choice movement are encouraging women to cheat.

No one is encouraging women to cheat in order to express their autonomy on any kind of significant scale. If anything, encouraging equality and autonomy places a greater degree of moral burden on your actions."
"idk dude, I attend a hyper-liberal university in a hyper-liberal area and, anecdotally, I've never met nor even heard of any actual real-life person who's like ""yeah I get in monogamous relationships with men but still cheat on them to FIGHT THE PATRIARCHY!"" 

Conversely, I *have* seen numerous incels and redpill types on the internet make that exact claim, that women nowadays all cheat on men because feminism.

Thus, while it's hypothetically possible that OP stumbled upon the one dumbass lady who thinks that feminism = cheating on men, it seems far more likely on balance that it's just some incel or redpill type trying to get people infuriated. The fact that this post hit frontpage and is filled with redditors furious about this evil tumblrina and her misguided ways would seem to suggest that this is an effective tactic."

Look out in the real world and you find that the vast majority (80%) of Americans are against political correctness. Plenty of communities on reddit will downvote you if you insist political correctness is a real thing.

79% of people believe illegal immigration is bad for America, and 57% believe border security should be a top priority for immigration reform. Take those views to Twitter and you'll get dragged and outnumbered by everyone.

And how about the viral kerfuffle last month about how cops shouldn't be in pride parades? I saw it all over Facebook, Reddit, and Twitter. In real life, 79% of LGBT parade participants said cops should indeed be in parades. 

In general, people who are always online believe their own views are much more widespread than in actuality. I really see this as a potential problem for Democratic candidates in 2020 who place an emphasis on internet trendy positions which are less popular among the American electorate."

That's a beautiful thing.
"The bestest boy.

One of my teammates had a seizure alert dog.  He traveled everywhere with her.  For games, he just tucked himself under the bench.  :)"
My pittie would think it's time to snuggle and just crawl all over me.
HERO DOGGO
We really don't deserve dogs
"Wow, it‚Äôs amazing how much dogs can do in the medical field. Really makes me feel useless."
Easiest straight to controversial of my life
"More than awww, awesome"
It amazes me to see the love and intelligence that animals esp dogs display.
That look of satisfaction on his face when he knows he is in the right position.

"Just to add a separate comment here, if anyone sees anyone having a seizure, unless they‚Äôre in immediate danger never touch them. Move any and all things they could hit when fitting or bang their head off but don‚Äôt hold their body etc...

When they come round be prepared for a whole lot of confusion."
There is so much we can learn from dogs. Being a good human is one.
Is she ok?
Somebody get him a treat.....NOW
Looks like a perfect clone of my sister's pit-weimaraner mix. Charlie probably wouldn't do that though. He'd just grab a toy and drop it on your head.
Good pillow boye
"I have epilepsy (grand mal/tonic clinic), a colleague begged me to get a service dog so we could have a little buddy in the office but I don‚Äôt think mine are severe or frequent enough. Would be kind of nice though! I have a boxer/mastiff at home who did not seem to care or notice when I had a tonic clinic seizure at home causing a black eye and concussion when I was 5 months pregnant. She just kept on sleeping when I was seizing then waking up trying to figure out who the hell I am afterwards. Dumb dog! But I love her anyways."
#WHO'S CHOPPING ONIONS?!
"This is not a Pitbull, but a Lab-Weimaraner mix. 

People, in general, are terrible at discerning breeds and mixed breeds, but one can easily see why it can be so difficult with OP's post. It's also why records of dog (breed) attacks can be extremely unreliable."
I guess my dog thinks I‚Äôm having a seizure when I do push ups...maybe I should work on my form
It's amazing how they train these dogs
Plot twist the dog triggers the seizures to get its backed rubbed

Pitbull runs 2 miles to bite owner having a seizure
This has been posted more than almost any other post. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it was the most reposted of all time. It‚Äôs not even that good.
Is she having an actual seizure or is this a training type scenario?
"Oh man, this. is. amazing. My brother has terrible seizures where he screams out and thrashes violently. He seized once in the bathroom and I made it just in time to prevent him from busting his head on the sink, then the toilet, then the shower. No easy task since he is 6ft and I'm 5ft."
OP is a spammer.
"Pitbulls get such a bad media rap because of the people that raised them to fight.   I've been around lots of pitbulls fostered and adopted with 0 problems.   In fact most of them are actually pretty wussy, the one I have now is scared of rain even.   He'll hold in his pee for hours and hours rather than get wet."
"This is so heartwarming (not the woman having a seizure of course), but the fact of how animals are there for us in our times of need. I'm so sick and tired of people saying how pitbulls are so mean and violent...it's not the breed themselves, it's how people raise them."
What an amazing pupper!!
That is amazing!
Pitbulls are the best!
"Seeing all the comments bout how the pitbull being vicious when the video ends or are vicious in the first place... Motherfuckers do realise 90% of the time... fuck maybe all the time... it comes down to their owners and how they've raised them and trained them. I've got a StaffyxMastif at home as a guard dog and he dont hold back when from the fence when a stranger arrives till I call put... you put a kid there and he'll crawl up wagging his tail then put his head down and stay still while the kid pats him, kids that are fucking 3 to 6 years old....."
" He‚Äôs a lab x Weimaraner, not pitty. @servicedogcolt on ig"

Plz give him extra treats

How do they train this behavior? Dog is amazing. My ‚Äúservice‚Äù maltipoo can only open doors that have long toys attached. Now he barrels through rooms not needing humans ‚Äî his training helps him more üòÇ

That's so sweet. I hope he got a treat and a nice lil' hug or pat at the end for a job well done or a lesson well learned.
"His face is the same as my face when i'm holding the tail-lift button on the flatbed truck at work. Just gotta hold still and wait for the thing to finish.

Also when i pee, i guess. Except sometimes i whistle when i pee."
Because that's what heroes do.
My dog does this all the time just to be cute

I hope it goes better for her than it did for Homer Utterback
"If she‚Äôs acting, I gotta say that‚Äôs pretty spot on for what seizures can look like.  Hollywood doesn‚Äôt quite seem to have it figured out."
My sister has seizures she's having a hard time getting put on disability and how does she go about getting a dog for her seizures that's be amazing
Such a good boy!
"Doctors of reddit,

When you have a seizure, do you actually realize that you are having a seizure but just have no control. Or you are out of it?"
i think hes like 99.99% helping but .01% of him wants pats
That's pretty incredible. Dogs are amazing.
Taking one for the team boys!
So damn cool!
oh shit i thougt that was a dog doing sit-ups
Sweet dog hope he doesn‚Äôt get hit to hard

My fiance needs this. I wish we could afford it :(
My pitbull does this whenever I just put my head on the ground. It‚Äôs like a game to him where his head has to be under.
"Had a friend in highschool who stepped out to his porch for a smoke and had a seizure. He hit his head on a rock and died.

Also, as a pitbull lover, this makes me tear up."
Wow ... its not alot to say ...but  wow
He really took his time there. No urgency in kids these days
Amazingly good pup
I love this.

Good job doggo!
"Does this dog (and service dogs in general) know why they are doing what they are trained to do, to any degree? Like do they just automatically carry out an action that they‚Äôve been trained to do in response to certain cues, or do they know they‚Äôre helping to protect their owner?"
Yet another reason why we don‚Äôt deserve dogs
"Don‚Äôt mind me crying over here.....oh dogs, we don‚Äôt deserve you."
Amazing
We don‚Äôt deserve them
This is so amazing I absolutely love this dogs
"This is awesome. First time my mom had a seizure, she was by herself and came out of it to one of our dogs licking her hand because she was clenching so hard she broke the skin on her palm. I'd love to get her a service dog for this."
"Thats an awsome dog 
üêï"
"Dog: it looks like you want to pet me with your head. It‚Äôs a little weird, but I‚Äôll go along with it."
Wow! That's amazing that dogs can be trained to intervene like that!

The Dogs series on Netflix is awesome. First episode is about training these dogs.
I wonder how they trained him?
That's amazing!
What did we do to deserve dogs
15/10 is the goodest pupper
Why is that camera there? Is this a training excercise?
Are you able to control your seizures with medication?
"I had a college professor show off her medical alert bracelet the first day of the semester. Told us to call the number there if needed because ambulances rides are expensive. Basically said, 'If I fall over it's all good. Please don't call 911. This is totally normal. It shouldn't happen, but if it does just call my husband. His number is on my medical alert bracelet. Unless I whack my head on a table. Then you can call 911. Unless that happens he'll come get me and I'll just wonder why I teleported home.'

Struck me as odd that every now and again she'd just wake up somewhere like, 'oh. This is new.'"
"Hey, this thing has been bothering me for a little.

I encountered a lady at the corner of the street as I was heading back from the gym.  She looked at me weird and then told me she was going to have a seizure.  

I helped her down and held her head while she seized.  I tried calling 911 but my phone decided to not let the call thru (Wtf right?) but another bystander called them for me.  The paramedics came and took her.

Now the thing I'm wondering is - should we not have called 911?  I had since read all these stories of people NOT wanting 911 called because of the ridiculous bills they get.  

And I realized I'd be pissed if I got a bill of like $1000 when all I needed was to make sure someone protected my head while I seized.  :-/ 

What's the proper response?  911 or wait until they feel better and ask if they want/need one?"
I once went into one and fell into a table. Smashed a testicle. By smashed.. i mean popped
"Ugh. For a period of time I was having seizures, about 2 generalized ones a week sometimes more if I was stressed (They stopped on their own, docs think it was TBI plus a med I was on). One time I was at the bank dealing with an issue. I was stressed out. Next thing I know I wake up to a paramedic rolling me into my back and I hear him say, ""large hematoma under the right eye"". I had had a massive seizure at the bank, and when I went down apparently my face hit the corner of the counter. Took months to heal and my boyfriend refused to go out with me cause people would confront him thinking he hit me. Went to the bank the next day and the employees were very kind and asked me how I was doing and seemed genuinely worried."
"One seizure I had was when I was in the shower. I slipped and hit my head on the faucet. My mom found me face down in the shower passed out with the shower still running. 

Broke my nose because of it."
Yes exactly. The confusion of your location when you come to is borderline horrifying. I had an episode in jail and woke up in this fly infested room on the floor with no blanket. I am scarred for life from that. I was freaking out
"Do you know when you have a seizure, are you aware during the episode?"
"If you don't mind me asking, what exactly goes through your head when a seizure happens?

Can you perfectly comprehend what's going on, does your brain just get completely messed up for a minute, or is it just suddenly all black and then you're back?"
"And the feeling of absolute exhaustion/soreness like you just did the tour de France.

-also epileptic üëé"
"If you aim for the ground, you're in control 100% of the time."
Do you want people to call you an ambulance when it happens?
"I'm 16, never had a seizure, could the problem still pop up for me somewhere along the line?"
Wow that‚Äôs awesome
Yep
"Am also epileptic, I have grand mals though. It's scarier for the people watching since I'm blacked out the whole time"
Would you like to tell the side effects of your seizures???
"Two epileptic kids.... before I even opened the video, I knew it wouldn't  show the dog leaping between the corner of the glass coffee table and the falling head of the person.   What I see here is aww, but as a parent this isn't what worries me in the slightest.  It's the initial fall."
have you looked into CBD for that? I've seen it do miracles for seizures.
"It's so scary, and when I snap out of it I'm so confused and grumpy. :("
"I know it‚Äôs not the same, but my lab had epilepsy. We finally found the right dosage of phenomenal and it stopped them, but it would be so scary and stressful for me, I could only hope he wasn‚Äôt scared too."
True that.
Cameron boyce ended up in heaven.
"Is it scary? Like are you aware as you lose control?

I never thought about the mental and emotional impact until a friend started having seizures... but imagining it seems like it would be very disturbing. üòì

I read that your meds work in another comment (but didnt read all the other comments) so I'm happy for you in that respect!"
"I‚Äôve ended up under my bed with a broken arm, in a crowded corridor, on the floor at work blind in one eye, on a table with a smashed up phone and face üòÖ

I wish having a seizure dog was feasible for me tbqh"
"Had someone have their very first seizure right as they were entering my store. Poor girl was terrified. Did my best to pad her head with a rag and called emergency services. Didn't see any ID or bracelets. She ended up coming out of it about 30 seconds before we could hear the sirens.

I still think about her and wonder if she's alright."
There are so many people out there that do not understand how wonderful dogs really are and that just makes me sad for them
"Dogs and humans have had a relationship for thousands of years. Ancient burial ground of forager homo sapiens were dug up, humans and dogs were buried next to each other. Crazy stuff"
Never seizes to amaze me.
"Dog is like ‚ÄúI got you my human, you‚Äôll be ok‚Äù. Tugs my heart strings."
"Lost my dog last month, one week before his birthday. When I was 17 and had a tough time at school, he always brightened my day by his excitement.

Now that I am 28, I left work as soon as I got the call about his diagnosis to pick up my wife who also had to leave work. To be told his surgery costs 8k and only 3 months to live afterwards, we would have paid it if he could live longer but ultimately his comfort is our priority. He passed on surrounded by his family. 

It has left a hole in our lives. 

He didn't show any signs of cancer and was the best companion one could ask for. I miss him so much and thankful I have some videos of him."
Exactly. Dogs are so great. I wonder if they ever feel like they get a raw deal.
"It's his nothing-face. Just laying down, doing his doggy-job."
"""I do so good, I do good job"""
"If it makes you feel a little better, the dog is being trained to help people with epilepsy. The woman is faking it (for lack of a better term) to teach the doggo how to help more people."
We seriously don‚Äôt deserve dogs.
"Same. My brother has seizures and I've never seen him have one, but this breaks my heart in so many ways."
I am crying right now and trying not to show it because I am at a hookah lounge trying to maintain my cool lol.
"I would honestly love to know the origins of that dog because while he doesn't look 100% pit or anything like that, he certainly looks like he has some bully breed in him.  The face shape just doesn't seem quite right to me for a lab/weim mix, but to be fair, visual id of breed mixes isn't exactly super accurate."
She‚Äôs also featured heavily on r/illnessfakers
Is pitbull even a breed? Or just a label that dozens of different dog types with similar features get lumped into along with the stigma?
"Yeah, just an FYI, lots of signs (photos, etc) point to his owner (the owner of the YouTube account service dog colt) having Munchausens Syndrome, meaning she is taking/exaggerating her illnesses for money/attention."
"Well these dogs are trained to do this, it's not like they automatically know what to do."
"Yes, was to show the pups training."
Training
Availability if CBD oil is the primary reason I voted to legalize recreational marijuana in my state. Now it's in grocery stores all over here. I hope the rest of the country can get the same soon! Someone else in the thread said CBD isn't necessarily the miracle drug people claim it to be (not for everyone anyway) but it sure would be nice if more people had the option of trying it for themselves.
Are your seizures controlled?
CBD is very popular in North Carolina... I live next to a dispensary
Me and my wife live in North Carolina and she Vapes CBD oil for back pain. We buy it legally from a vape store and she also has CBD balm for topical relief. If you're wondering we live in the Mount Airy area.
"Ohmygawd, I needed that. Thank you."
"With you here. I'm a big fan of weed, I'm high right now. But I wish all these stoners would stop yelling about CBD like its a magic cure-all and the world's best kept secret.  They are taking something that may be a very good thing in certain cases and turning it into quack science, on par with healing crystals and shit.  Obviously it helps some people with some ailments, but these people are acting like doctors and have no clue what they're talking about.  Somebody told me to give my 18 months old daughter CBD for teething. Wtf.

And now they're pushing it on pets too.  I have seen and heard so many people recommending CBD dog treats for treating anxiety, upset stomaches, destructiveness, etc. Take your pet to the vet, ask about it, see what the doctor recommends.  And put in some time for training before trying to basically drug them for doing what dogs do. 

Rant over."
What a random rant.  Where did this come from?  It's a video of a dog.
"CBD oil is for suckers. Obviously, the best treatment is lavender essential oils."
Epileptic here and I concur.
"Insert Fibromyalgia or chronic pain, nerve damage, etc in there for Epilepsy and then replace CBD with one from here ‚Äî-> (yoga, weight loss, medical marijuana, latest fad diet, probiotics, antidepressants, be braver, try harder, more sleep, meditation, exercise, physical therapy, cold laser therapy, positive thinking, law of attraction, prayer, just push through it, fight harder, use patience, try the cleanse, go to the acupuncturist, chiropractor, neurologist, rheumatologist, physiologist, sleep study, cut stress/fat/salt/toxins/gluten/etc, get some sun/outdoor time/nature/gratitude, stop taking so many medications/going to so many doctors, practice self care, move to a better climate, take more vitamins and for gosh sake get some essential oils!

Did I miss any? Go ahead and add your own. I‚Äôve had 15 years of this to work from."
Amen
Yup.
Yea I've seen this on Reddit like 100 times lol.
Almost as cute as you
"I came to say the same thing, unless they are hitting their head, let the body do its thing. As horrific as seizures are, it is the bodies way turning on and off in some cases. My First Aid course was a real eye opener. 

Side story, the day after my First Aid course I had to sit and watch a child (14 yr old) have an epileptic fit for 9 minutes, sitting there, doing nothing went against all of my instincts, but so glad I went on the course."
She was probably just simulating a seizure to help the pup learn what they could look like and react accordingly.
Third word of the title ;)
Your cat would probably look at you for a minute then go sleep on the couch.
"I‚Äôm no expert but this is my understanding of them. 

Seizures are misfires happening in the brain causing anything from loss of consciousness to body spasms. Sometimes
 a person is conscious other times theyre not 

It look really rough to live with. 

Edit  due to broken phone screen"
"In this exact case, she is banging her head on the floor to simulate a seizure in order to train the dog. 

But a seizure can be thought of as similar to a surge of electrical signals in the brain. It can cause loss of control of functions, like speech or control of movement, or focus. The simulation there is a phase called ""clonic"" where there is uncontrolled jerking of the body."
"Train lie down
Train crawl
Train to recognise owner falling on the ground as a trigger for the behaviour 


You can train seemingly complex behaviours as long as you start off small :)"
It depends on the type of seizure. Also the level of consciousness can vary.
"Epileptic here: Everytime I've had a seizure I've had these migraines where my head feels like its being pulled apart and exploding at the same time, whilst everything in my vision and hearing is on a 1 second gif loop, once the pain reaches its highest I just black the fuck out"
"Not a doctor but work with people who have epilepsy. It depends on the type of seizure. I've found that people with absence seizures often don't tend to know exactly what it going on, they sometimes know something is wrong but not why. I've also known people with mild clonic seizures who will be able to talk to you and let you know they are having a seizure, and people who get auras that give them a clue one is coming.

You usually don't have to do too much unless it goes on for too long, they injure themselves during it or they are trialling new meds."
The camera?
Keep searching... many times service dogs can be worked out with little to no out of pocket because of donations by various groups to those in need. Don't stop asking... be vigilant. Good luck to you and the fiance.
"The dog is still in training, so this is just practice and not a real seizure."
Oh god yeah. Doesn‚Äôt bother me at all
Yes. My mom's on dilantin for her seizures... She had a second when she just started the medicine but she hasn't had another one for about 13 years now. It can have side affects though.
"Well that's the idea but sometimes people get one anyway and once it kicks in, then you have no control for the duration."
">Struck me as odd that every now and again she'd just wake up somewhere like, 'oh. This is new.'

I had a seizure for the first time a couple months ago and let me tell you, it is a mindfuck.  I remember the conversation I was having just a couple minutes before, and then the next thing I know I'm 'waking up' in an ambulance outside my office building, although apparently I had been conscious and answering questions/moving under my own steam for quite a period of time before I 'woke up', but I remember none of it.  I've been told stories by my co-workers, but it still feels like something that happened to someone else (except for the lingering back pain due to whatever unknown injury happened to my back while I was seizing).  Apparently during the time that was conscious but don't remember, when they were trying to assess my mental state, they asked me if I knew my co-worker's name and I was like ""yup!  It's 8B"".  Her name is Sharon and I don't have the faintest clue where 8B came from, LOL."
"""ambulance rides are expensive""

Ah yes, the American way of healthcare"
Yeah that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm glad I live in the UK. Have t gotta worry about ambulances and remortgaging my house
"I cant tell you how many people ""woke up"" and went ""fuck not this again"" when I was an emt."
"> Now the thing I'm wondering is - should we not have called 911?

The basic procedure is call the ambulance if: 

1) Their 1st time having a seizure  

 or 

2) the seizure lasts longer than 5 minutes.  

What this means is this lady almost certain had a regular issue with seizures, so it likely wasn't her first time.  But in health emergencies, you don't want to risk someone's life to save a little cash. Under the circumstances, you did OK (it sounded like the seizure wasn't too short either)."
"Generally, you're supposed to call if the person stops breathing or the seizure lasts more than 5 minutes, but that can be changed depending on the individual's history. That's just the official guidelines I've been given in various classes (I worked with special needs kids, so had basic seizure response training, along with knowing individual plans for my students)."
"It‚Äôs situation dependent. Personally I don‚Äôt have one, but in the UK it‚Äôs not really a problem, I‚Äôve just told the medics I don‚Äôt need to go to hospital n that‚Äôs it really"
You can‚Äôt be expected to act as a medical professional and know when or when not to call the ambulance. How would you feel if you didn‚Äôt call and she ended up dying?
"Check for a medical alert bracelet which may saw who to call (911 or spouse, etc). When in doubt, call for an ambulance. Hubby has a TBI and epilepsy as a result and we are supposed to call 911 per his doctor's advice. Some people have mild seizures that don't do much and they hop back up and proceed with their day. Others need a full medical workup to make sure the brain is still ok. When my husband has one he needs to recover for days to weeks and is incredibly fatigued."
"How do you feel about the incident with the money excluded? The only time I've been a first responder to a seizure, it was a friend having their first when we were both 12-13, and the sound of his head on the asphalt (before I understood what was happening) stuck with me for a while. Making these service dogs frigging awesome, and begging the question, you good?"
"I think it's situation dependent. My mom is epileptic, and has a seizure at least once a week. If she doesn't fall and hit her head, we just get her through it and go on, but she's hardly ever around someone who wouldn't know how she reacted (she has other health issues, too, so is never by herself). But she'd feel better for someone to call an ambulance if she were in public and seized than not."
AHHHHHH I'm a woman and this horrifies me. R.I.P. testi. :-(
Oh. How....does one recover from that?
Imma need some details here about this testicle. Popped as in it bust? Or it popped up inside you? Or popped out like your scrotum was cut? What was the outcome of the testicle?
ow fuck man.  If I werent so cheap I'd dap you up with a gold for your fallen lil bro.
"Jeez that's terrifying. You were so close to dying and this is one of my biggest fears of how I'm going to go.

I was a kid and my shower sliding door fell on me while in the shower and I was trapped and I had to wait for both of my parents to come to get me out."
"Hey monster Mike 7777, Samuel L Chang here... 
If you could do me a favor and drop that life story in the comments below I'd appreciate it."
"Nope, basically unconscious but still standing around. It‚Äôs really weird. Sometimes I‚Äôll go a little woozy and it‚Äôs like I‚Äôm looking through someone else‚Äôs eyes. 

Best example I can think of is the film hardcore Henry"
"I have grand mal/full body seizures and normally I black out and then wake up when it's over, but once...once for some reason I was semi-concsious while it was happening. Now, the way I understand the mechanism, your brain is sending uncontrolled impulses to all your muscles, causing them to contract and relax as hard as they can. 

*All* your muscles. 

If you've ever used a TENS unit across a muscle on low frequency, you know what it's like to suddenly be out of control of the contraction of a muscle. The unfortunate thing is that during a seizure, that includes your diaphragm. The best way I can describe it is like drowning on dry land ‚Äî I was aware that I was having a seizure (kinda) and trying to breathe but because my diaphragm was involuntarily contracting, I couldn't. 

Try not to be alert during a grand mal seizure, folks."
Nothing st all honestly can‚Äôt remember a thing
"I asked my mom this once and she told me it's just lost time. She said sometimes you don't even notice you've had one if you're just sitting at the computer or in bed.

She did mention that sometimes when she's coming out of one, she'll understand she had one because she'll feel kind of like she's drugged up and she is usually quite tired but most of the time it's just lost time."
"While I don't have epilepsy or any other seizure-causing illness myself, my stepmom had something similar to absence seizures  a few times due to a spinal disc herniation where she in the middle of talking would completely zone out and stare into space for up to a minute while smacking her lips or similar things.

She told me that she didn't remember it when it happened but she could feel the onset by her head becoming cloudy and her focus slipping. I could also tell by her speech becoming slightly slurred, and her not responding properly when talking.

 When my dad wasn't home she used to ask me to keep check on her in case the seizure went on for too long so I could call for an ambulance."
"It greatly depends on the type of seizure. For me: during grand mal/tonic-clonic seizures, nothing -- it's pretty much like being unconscious. For partial/absence/petit mal seizures, it's like I'm under twilight sedation -- not quite alert or awake but not totally out. The aura that precedes a seizure is the hardest to describe; it is like my thoughts are covered in a layer of Jell-O and the world is distorted. Everything sounds like my head is underwater and I'm stuck in a dream where everything is in slow-mo."
Don't forget the headache!
I have no idea what‚Äôs happening so I have no opinion at the tone lol. I‚Äôve only had 2 guts out of house so I got ambulances called then by the people who found me
"Maybe, just don‚Äôt be worried about it if it does. Make sure you don‚Äôt let it control your life."
Yeah I find that it effects people around me more so than me. Other than the exhaustion that follows one
"Well if you imagine going to the gym n working out so hard you have no energy left to lift yourself up that kinda sums up the physical side. 

Feels like your brain has been scrambled, tongue will be chewed to shit where the jaw clamps shut,  any injuries gained from falling over too don‚Äôt help"
Yeah I would it mine weren‚Äôt controlled and if it was affecting my daily life but it hasn‚Äôt had an impact on me basically
Yeah the initial confusion can be a bit disorientating
Yeah my border collie had it as well. One epileptic and one diabetic collie lol
"Some people can tell when they have one coming on so can sit down or get comfy, the full seizures I‚Äôve had were out the blue"
The same people who don't recognize the wonderful relationships that you can have with dogs are the same people who would not spend the time with a dog to have that wonderful relationship.
"Some people give me shit for treating my dog like it's my child.

[I love my child](https://imgur.com/pFdrLFE). 

He's helped me go through a tough moment of my life and a bunch of other shit that I don't know what my life would've been without him by my side during these times"
They are called cat persons
"Agreed. He's a lovely dog, but this is his work face."
"It helps a little. Well, okay, I still cry because the good boi rushes in to protect her. lol"
"Yeah we do, it's one of the few things we got right."
"Humans made them the way they are, so yes we do."
"Seriously.. I wish I could agree anymore but I can't.. There is no more agree I can agree

It hurts me so bad that I have a rescue that was beaten by men and hes terrified of me when all I want to do is hold and pet him. I have to lay on the floor and look the other way to even get my hand sniffed."
"Agreed. Rose ears would not occur in a weim x lab mix, either."
I was going to say this. I own a pit/plot hound mix and this dog definitely has the head structure of a pit breed
Looks like a staffordshire bull terrier to me. Very popular breed where I am but difficult for shelters to rehome.
"Not to defend the person in the video, but the dogs need to be trained somehow right, probably by someone who doesn't have the illness so they have to fake it to train the dog"
Good lord that sub feels so toxic.
"What a weird stalky subreddit. They even have ""No Whiteknighting/Coddling OTTs"" in their rules. It's literally against the rules to be too nice to whatever random people they are making claims about not being actually ill."
Oh god I agree deeply that it‚Äôs definitely at least not entirely true but the dogs not a pitbull
I mean technically only an APBT (American Pitbull terrier) is a pitbull but usually any kind of mutt who has some sort of bully breed dog in them gets labeled as such thus leading to said stigma
"So ""pitbull"" is often used as a general term to indicate dogs that are american pit bull terriers, stafforshire bull terriers, american bulldogs, and sometimes some others.

Generally in the ""dog world"" people will call all the above breeds and some more (including English Bulldogs, Bull Terriers, and more - including Boston Terriers) ""bully breeds"" and say that ""pit"" only applies to the american pit bull terrier.

But that's the difference between jargon from a specific community and what's generally used."
"Lots of people look at the shape/size of the head and lump them in with actual pitbulls. The stigma can get pretty crazy. Leads to all sorts of problems with condo associations, or renting apartments if you have a dog that looks even remotely like a pitbull (even if it isn't one). And if the dog is only part pitbull it seems lots of places would just consider it a pitbull instead of a mutt"
Oh that makes sense
He couldnt read the first time
"If you can be sure that what you're getting is actually a cannibinoid, than it can work wonders. Unfortunately it's unregulated. You could be getting something that is largely proylene glycol if it's in oil form."
Yes.  I haven‚Äôt had one since 2011.
"Isn't it expensive as all fuck, considering it's extracted from a fast growing plant?"
"It wasn't random. Someone above mentioned CBD oil, again. Rather than unleash on them directly I found it more appropriate to post separate because they don't deserve ALL of that. However this rant is very relatable to those who have experienced to what I am referring."
GTFO out of here with that essential oil BS everyone knows crystals are the only things that work.
"OMG, sometimes I even amaze myself with stupidity! Thanks!"
Phew.
I've heard about people using CBD to control seizures but mostly in children. Have you tried it/is there any insight you can offer about it's effectiveness?
So I was right! Haha!
Same
"8B lmao. The first time I had a seizure I was in my first semester of college. The EMT said ""do you know why I'm here?"" and I said ""to go to college??"" Then he asked me who the president was (this was 2009) and apparently I super sassily  replied ""Obama duhhh!"""
"Yes! It‚Äôs the most bizarre thing. 

I‚Äôve had two. First I went to sleep at home, woke up in the E.R. Second, I was talking to a coworker, woke up in the E.R. Apparently she semi-caught me on the way down and kept me from bashing my head on anything when I fell, so she has my eternal gratitude.  

Both times completely disorienting and confusing, in different ways. 

I remember being super calm the first time though, probably from whatever drug cocktail they gave me in the ambulance/E.R. To stabilize me. It was sort of a slow realization I was in the hospital followed by ‚ÄúHuh...that‚Äôs not good. I wonder why I‚Äôm here.‚Äù

The second time my thoughts were basically ‚ÄúDammit, not again.‚Äù

It‚Äôs so weird though, to have these blocks of time, that were so defining to the people around me: my family worried sick, my wife thought I was dying during the first one (since she had no idea what was going on), my coworker freaked out (understandably), etc., and I remember only blips."
"While, yes, also, not only America. In Canada you still have to pay a fee for an ambulance ride, the fee varies by province and could be anything from $45 to over $500. And even this cost deters low income and seniors from calling. üòû Which is stupid because studies have shown that this costs lives when people wait too long to call for help. The Coast Guard figured it out long ago and that‚Äôs why they don‚Äôt charge for rescues. When people have to weight risk against cost, they take more risks!"
It is literally cheaper to get a speeding ticket for going 50 over the limit than to take an ambulance ride from my house to the level 1 trauma center just a mile away up the road.
My bf just had major surgery and has years of medical debt from lifelong illness. We're considering having him file bankruptcy... Yay America.
"Yeah, even with insurance an ambulance ride can cost hundreds or over a thousand, plus an ER visit and if it's out of network for your insurance it's even more expensive. And really, all they'd do is tell her, 'you had a seizure' and she'd go, 'yep. Sometimes that happens. Usually doesn't. Happens, though.' And then a $1500 bill with that."
"Agree  Hopefully Borris Johnson Et al, doesn't wreak that for us."
"Jesus Christ, thank fuck for the NHS"
You just put a band-aid on it and inflate it again
As in i went to the hospital and had to do some internal stitches and make sure things had not been further damaged. Everything healed up fine. Just a small scar that blends right in. At the time when I cane to I was instantly vomiting. Felt like someone reached up and grabed you by the balls and pulled you to your knees. By far one of my least favorite experiences so far.
u/monstermike7777 please see above request. Tag you‚Äôre it!
">Try not to be alert during a grand mal seizure, folks.

Highly recommend the not being alert part.  Apparently I was foaming at the mouth and making scary sounds as well.  So glad I have no recollection."
"Damn, that must be jarring, suddenly just being in a different spot than you were a moment ago, confused and potentially injured.

I saw that you have medication for it that works. I'm glad you don't have to deal with that much if at all."
This used to be me. I was bitten by my own chihuahua at 8. Anything bigger I was terrified of! But then one night I took MDMA with my best pal and had the courage to go hang with her pitty. Somewhere in my haze I saw him for how beautiful he was and he was so gentle too. I‚Äôm not afraid of puppers anymore.
"That‚Äôs what i think. Anybody who doesn‚Äôt like dogs just doesn‚Äôt know or had a bad initial interaction. 

Dogs are mankind‚Äôs sidekick."
"Eh dogs are better than human children.

Nobody is ever like ""Oh that brown poodle? That's my estranged pet, we don't really go on walks anymore."""
A dog is a pet...
Oh my God that's one of the best derp faces I've ever seen
"Reggie is not my only child, but he was my first"
I went back to verify. I think you're correct.
humans don‚Äôt deserve dogs
Exactly. Name a more iconic teaming up than man and wolf? Bros throughout history.
Uh pugs? We did not get pugs right lol
"Inbreeding was the right thing to do? Look at pugs and boxers man their lives aren't all sunshine rainbows just because you're happy. Yeah dogs are great but let's not be so ignorant to say we have ""done a great thing""."
"Not sure humans really deserve all the good things we have. Some, sure. I guess we can argue about the philosophical definition of ""deserve,"" but I certainly wouldn't say humans are entitled to the love we get from dogs."
"Truth!  Also that furrow in the top of his skull (I cannot remember for the life of me what that's called right now).  While labs (particularly show line) can have some of that, but weims don't so that would be particularly surprising.

Still, could totally have lab and weim, but also some sort of bully as well."
"The dog is hers. She's not training him for someone else. 

Service dogs are often trained, at least in part, by their handlers. Some have a natural ability to detect things like seizures, so then it's just a matter of teaching them what behaviors to perform once they're aware. I have a dog who can detect them, but is just a pet. We were pretty surprised when he signaled a seizure for a guest (wouldn't let her get off the couch until after). He'd be a crappy service dog because he has issues that make him insanely difficult to train, but he still got the message through."
That‚Äôs not why she‚Äôs on illnessfakers. No one is claiming the dog isn‚Äôt talented
"I'm genuinely confused, why wouldn't you want to defend someone who is working with their service dog? Did I miss something?"
Holy shit I just scrolled through some of it and one of the people they were bullying actually died.
Oh boy wait until I tell you about LOLcow or KiwiFarms
"You know, people wonder why pitbull owners get defensive about their dogs. There are cities where pit bulls are banned, it would be weird if the owners weren't defensive."
I have a pitbull mix and had the humane society list a different breed when I adopted him so that I didn't run into issues with my home insurance
Great to hear. It's such an awesome feeling to finally have that stability.
Lol a bottle of vape juice is $35 and has lasted several months (she doesn't vape as much as a nicotine user). The balm is $40 and hasnlasyed several months as well.
"Sir, I will burn sage to cleanse this post of your ridiculous comments!!"
It happens to the best of us ;) Happy to be on the other side of it for a change üòÖ
It‚Äôs apparently effective but for my particular case it‚Äôs not needed as mines controlled with medication
"Not the OP, but a fellow epileptic. I tried it with no success, but that doesn't mean it doesn't work. Different people react differently. Pretty much any epilepsy medication, including CBD, has the potential to decrease or increase your seizures. It's not the miracle drug that some people make it out to be (mostly people who've never had a seizure but love any excuse to smoke pot), but it's also helped a lot of people who were unresponsive to other drugs."
Epileptic here as well! I‚Äôve tried multiple different medications for my seizures all with horrendous side effects. The one I take now works for the most part but I still had seizures every few months UNTIL I started using CBD (around November last year). I haven‚Äôt had one since. It is truly a beautiful thing.
Also an epileptic...I almost wanted to try CBD oil but my doctor said it was only effective in one specific type of medication resistant for of epilepsy. Otherwise it helps but not any more or less than other meds. I'm seizure free now due to the ketogenic diet and medicine. This dog is a true hero!
"Hi, I'm a pediatric neurology nurse! I manage upwards of 40 kids using Epidiolex (the only FDA approved CBD oil). The efficacy is great for most of our patients. It is only indicated right now for two types of seizure disorders, Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. Parents report that it helps number of seizures. One parent told us her child who had more than 30 seizures a day went 3 weeks without a seizure when she started taking Epidiolex. It's a great drug but does require some maintenance. It can cause elevated liver enzymes so there is some bloodwork that needs to be done fairly regularly. So far, that's the worst we have heard and it's been nearly a year since we started putting patients on it."
it‚Äôs shown to work for a rare seizure disorder where unfortunately they have seizures much more often and medicine doesn‚Äôt help as food as it does for epilepsy. i can remember the name of the disorder but CBD was shown to lessen the seizures.
"I have ESRD and have had a few seizures myself. Once in dialysis there was a guy in a chair just across from me who started having a full on grand mal seizure, apparently it was a common thing for him cause the technician already knew to grab the CBD tincture from his bag and give him a few drops of it. It straight up stopped his seizure within a minute."
"Yes me father has TBI, cbd isn‚Äôt on of his seaside medications but he uses it as a relaxing agent to keep him from having them,"
It depends on the type of seizure. There are many different types.
"My brother uses CBD to control his. He has a disease called Sanfilippo Syndrome, which in some kids causes seizures. The CBD is very effective and he doesn't have much seizures anymore. Of course he still has some because I believe epilepsy is not able to be cured but he barely has any. Maybe two a month now."
That's only for very specific type of seizure IIRC
"There‚Äôs a new CBD medication that just came on the market for epilepsy,  called Epidiolex. For those with seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and Dravet Syndrome."
My 16 year old cousin is severely disabled- she has the physical and mental ability of a 9 month old baby. CBD has helped her seizures a lot. It does work.
Not effective for my daughter. Actually made her seizures worse.
I thought this said CBT at first and got extremely terrified.
"From my understanding, CBD was used to treat one specific case of epilepsy in a little girl and it worked. After that the market for CBD blew-up. CBD became a cure for everything and there is little evidence to prove that it does cure the things people sell/buy it for. It could very well be just snake oil. I think some CBD products that have been tested for validation in labs even have had bits of THC in them. Just like anything else, supplement-wise, CBD is probably bullshit, especially if the product bought has a ""proprietary blend."""
"There's been some indication that long term use might cause liver damage, so I wouldn't use it long term if you have other options. Or at the very least, tell your doctor and have your liver checked regularly."
Don't work made it worse for me
"LOL! Apparently when they asked me if I knew my name, the conversation went like this:

Paramedic: do you know your name?

Me: yup!

Paramedic: can you tell us your name?

Me: yup!

Paramedic: okay, tell us your name now

Me: *finally gives name*"
"My first seizure: Woke up to husband shouting ""What is my mother's maiden name?""  


HIS mother's maiden name??? Like I even know that on a regular day?  LOL"
"> It‚Äôs so weird though, to have these blocks of time, that were so defining to the people around me: my family worried sick, my wife thought I was dying during the first one (since she had no idea what was going on), my coworker freaked out 

Yeah, I feel like my co-workers were more scarred by the experience than I was, because they remember it."
"We had a lawsuit to through the courts where I live recently essentially forcing an insurance company to pay out and an air ambulance company to accept payment from them in regards to patient transport. The patient was air lifted to a larger facility out of state due to a life threatening condition, I forget specifics now, and they got a $20,000+ bill in the mail from the air ambulance company. Which was also the only air ambulance company to contacted with the hospital the patient was at, coincidentally. The patient was responsible for all of it, before the lawsuit, because the helicopter company was ""out of network"". The patient didn't have a choice, he/she would have died without the transfer to a more well equipped hospital and, if i recall correctly, the patient wasn't conscious to refuse transport based on cost. Not that the cost would have been given upfront anyways, mind you. But, life threatening or not, many people would voluntarily turn down care because of lack of affordability."
"Most states that's a suspended license, and possible jail time. That's much more costly for nearly everyone than a hospital bill that won't garnish your paycheck, just potentially wreck your credit."
"Medical bills are the most common cause of bankruptcy in America, may as well get the surgery over with and  make sure your medical bills are at max levels and then go for it.  THat's what my friend did."
It‚Äôs sickening
"That's exactly what happened to my husband when he had a seizure at work. All they did at the hospital was give him the same medication he had in his bag. The best part is he had just told his manager weeks before what to do if he had a seizure, but he wasn't there and didn't warn the other managers. All the bills together were over $1700."
"I wanna point out you can still call 911. I go to seizures all the time we dont transport on, in my state no transport means no bill. If someone has a seizure disorder and they had a seizure consistent with their past seizures and are postictal (wonkyness after a seizure) for what's normal for them and someone is there to watch them we just sit around for them to be normal then leave. There's always the chance that it could become status seizures ( a serious problem)."
I'm Canadian and my husband and I are $1200 in debt over ambulance bills for our 2 year old for seizures.
"It was 4k for me on a ""very good"" PPO insurance. And that was without lights or sirens which apparently cost extra (seriously.)

I'm seizure free for three years now! The meds suck, some more than others, but give them a long try. I want to stop mine everyday but still take them religiously. Where I live I will lose my license a minimum of one year if I have a seizure, that's happened too many times and causes a much lower quality of life than my meds do."
"It's not about the cost. It's more that going to the hospital for every single seizure isn't necessary. For some people, being stressed can increase seizures, so extra trips to the hospital can be a problem. It really depends a lot on the individual whether the hospital is necessary at all."
I'm picturing the autopilot scene in *Airplane!*
It‚Äôs weird. Takes a few minutes for your brain to settle
">Damn, that must be jarring, suddenly just being in a different spot than you were a moment ago, confused and potentially injured.

Yup, same thing happened to me when I had a seizure.  Was chatting with a coworker, then I'm in an ambulance and my back hurts and I'm really confused."
"That‚Äôs so sweet! I love pitbulls, they‚Äôre just the best dogs."

"Not just banned, people have had their dogs taken from them and euthanized."
Have you ever had a time period where you didn‚Äôt have access to your medication?
"Even with meds are there any risk factors? As in, things that could likely trigger a seizure (flashing lights, video games, etc), or is it essentially like you don't have the condition while medicated?"
"The most dangerous part of this wave of legalization is the lack of wide scale research of the ""miracle drug"" hysteria surrounding marijuana"
"Its also possible the particular extract you tried wasnt the right ‚Äúformulation‚Äù for you. The terpenes and other phyto-cannabinoids present are hard to achieve consistently.   
From experience i can say, cbd products tend to be inconstant due to lack of established/consistent testing requirements. It‚Äôs possible slight changes to production can effect the profile of cannabinoids in common distillates and tincture-like products(for example, not all Rick Simpson oil is made equal). Low quality starting material is often another limiting factor in final product. This industry is new and people are still learning. A lot more work needs to be done research wise in this field."
I'm so glad it's working for you
Lennox Gaustat and Dravet syndrome!
"even though CBD only works on specific seizure disorders that's still pretty fucking awesome to hear how well it works for people, I get tears in my eyes thinking about how much their quality of life is improved"
"There actually is now an FDA approved version of CBD called Epidiolex, and it is used primarily for two types of epilepsy syndromes called Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut.  There is good data supporting the use of CBD in those conditions, so it‚Äôs not entirely a snake oil situation, but there are certainly a lot of people who want to use it for all sorts of conditions for which there is little or flawed evidence."

"It's more it's scary people have to budget for healthcare and do a cost benefit analysis (or ask a stranger to do so, in this context) when ill"
"I both agree and disagree. As someone who suffers from several chronic illnesses (one of which includes falling a lot and passing out, thus being left to the hands of well-meaning strangers), I have printed not to call the ambulance on my cane (listing peoples numbers to call and other things unless it is absolutely necessary) because I simply can't afford those bills on top of all my medications and routine procedures. 
$1000 is a lot, and it is inconvenient having to deal with the hospital for something unnecessary, but with the 50k+ a year I owe medically, each dollar counts for me. Of course, different stories for everybody. This is just my two cents."
They really are! The anxiety comes back sometimes (I don‚Äôt drive and walk/bus everywhere) but rarely with a pitty.
"I love them too.

There is no ignoring, however, that they are big ass hunks of muscle. 

Pit playing with pit no worries. Most big dogs would be fine.

But pit playing with lapdog, it can get concerning if the pit gets too excited.

I forget this one breed but when I used to deliver medicine there was one family that always had me text before I got there because no matter what those dogs would try to attack me. Just ultra protective to a crazy extent."

"We tend to like things that sort of resemble human babies, and a lot of that has to do with eyes. I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if we've bred dogs to have more human-like eyes over the past tens of thousands of years."
"I fuckin love him! Thanks, that did brighten my day"
"Thank you man, he's beautiful"
That tongue! Thanks for sharing. Give him a big ol hug from a random internet stranger for me.
On to the next.

ty for asking
"PAL, that is the owner of the dog Janaye and she has conned people out of a lot of money on GoFundMe."
"She is absolutely the dogs owner, she fakes/exaggerates multiple illnesses to gain attention/money."
Same that was bothering me as someone who has chronic illnesses myself it‚Äôs not uncommon to have to go to multiple doctors because a lot don‚Äôt treat properly/know anything about your condition
Fortunately not. I have petit mal epilepsy so I have something called absent seizures
My friend did. The lights from the train tracks we crossed caused him to have a seizure. He had ordered his medications early and the pharmacy took forever refilling it. He was fine afterwards but you really feel for the embarrassment he went through even though he did what he was supposed to.
My roommates dog is epileptic and one time her meds got backordered and we ran out before more could come in.  She had a siezure the first night we didn't have meds.  Crazy stuff how she went so long on meds without a siezure and the first day off meds it happens right away.  After that we were able to get some sample meds from vet to hold us over until pharmacy had them back in stock
"Well it‚Äôs like an allergy really. Say your allergic to peanuts but you have a tablet that keeps the allergy at bay you‚Äôre not likely to eat peanuts 24/7. 

Mines mainly effected by extreme tiredness so as long as I get plenty of sleep I‚Äôm fine"
"It depends on what type of seizures.   
Photosensitivity isn't a trigger for all epileptics.   


If well controlled with medication, there are lots of epileptics that have no additional risk factors."
"OMG why is BIG POT try to tell me to just smoke weed???. The real cure for everything is jenkem!. If you ain't huffing poop, you're just a dupe."
"I‚Äôd say the lack of wide scale research has everything to do with its previous and current states of illegality and the stigma that attaches. Of course we need much more research to separate the snake oil claims from potentially legitimate medical uses, if any, but legalization is how we get there."
Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
"I definitely agree with you there. And it's absolutely horrible to know you absolutely NEED a hospital and it's a situation where you need to go through the ER, but the bill is going to be absolutely horrible after."
Any breed of dog can be dangerous if they aren‚Äôt trained well.  My mothers lapdog is vicious af.
I will! Tobias is always glad to put a smile on everybody's faces
"Truly a Legend, thanks!!"
Wow that's shitty.
What kind of con? Is she faking an illness?
"I had that as well when i was 9. Scary stuff. For me, I would lose consciousness, but would still be doing whatever I was doing. Then I‚Äôd ‚Äòwake up‚Äô 5-10 seconds later. Caused me to walk off a dock into a lake,  almost bike onto a very busy street before my Dad saved me, and some embarrassing school presentations lol"
"My son had those and we're still trying to get them fully controlled. He's not quite 6 and we expect them to go away during adolescence, but we'd really like to stop the seizures sooner rather than later."
I have those. I use medication and CBD to help. Still not 100% but working on it. Always genuinely encouraging to read about success from others though!
"Absence seizures is the term you‚Äôre looking for I believe, unless that was a typo."
Carbamazepine?
Jenkem - it‚Äôs the good shit!
Yeah. I started punching the tv once
I had those as a kid too. I would sort of just zone out for 15-20 seconds and my whole family and my teachers always blamed me for not listening/not paying attention. Then I got my EEG and they were all mortified at themselves lol
My son has them but he just stops what he's doing and trails off and his eyes roll up and to the left. He's back a few seconds later. We're working on getting them controlled and his meds are helping but not as much as we'd like
Let me tell you this: nobody cringes at the kid having a seizure. We're rooting for you and hoping for the best and that's it. You should never feel embarrassed.
Well that's not fucking terrifying
"I‚Äôve had three of those. Right after I started my meds. I thought they were a side effect and told my husband I was skipping time. 

I figured it out a month later. Luckily it stopped. I don‚Äôt need more or different types of seizures, or some after I started my meds."
I was 15 when I was diagnosed. They say it‚Äôs one of those 7 year things. That you‚Äôll grow out of it but I‚Äôve had mine for 15 years so far lol
My daughter has grand mal (tonic clonic) seizures. She's 2. They also expect her to grow out of them.
"For real, I don't run into many other epileptics (real life or online) and to hear someone has got their meds nailed down and has their seizures controlled makes me a happy camper"
Yeah absence/absent. Can go by both of them
"My friend did the same thing, he said that he thought the characters in the tv were behind the glass. He also had petite mal seizures but I‚Äôm not sure if they were related to him punching the tv lol. Maybe this is an r/tworedditorsonecup ?"
Story behind this?
I‚Äôm on the parent side of that right now. I feel terrible about it. But glad we now have a diagnosis and very effective medication.
I hope you are able to find whatever helps soon!!!
"The neurologist and things that I've found say that for kids as young as him it's between 80-90% to go away during adolescence. We're almost certain that my wife had them but went undiagnosed, and she doesn't have them now.

Sorry that you still have to deal with the condition after so long. Are you able to do things like drive or does the risk of seizing preclude you from that?"
Oof. I'm sorry that she (and you) have to go through that. At least the doctors expect them to go away eventually. Any luck with medication yet?
He‚Äôs a youtuber who was facescanned into the game by 2k
"This reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/x06GBDKUaaM) face scan from nba 2k15.
I still have to cry from laughing when i watch this, even though i've seen it for many times."
And then you have the monstrosity that was scanned by Geoff Ramsey..
"This reminds me of the Mii maker thing you could do with the Wii U camera. My wife did it and it looked great, so I gave it a try. Ended up looking like Peter Griffin. Big confidence boost there"
ATTENTION! this dude got scanned at the actual 2k headquarters. The normal customization is just alright. Don‚Äôt give 2k and credit and stop buying their shitty micro transactions filled games!
We've come a long ways from the ps2 eyetoy.
When Sims 3 came out I was creating a new Sim at some point with some friends over and when I opened up the Sim created it looked dead on my friend. One of the weirdest bit coolest coincidences I‚Äôve had gaming.
You guys remember the original toney hawk underground using this? Make yourself a skater was all the rage.
That's almost creepy
What game?
Seems like an ad
Zack_TTG was specially scanned because he got flown out by 2k to get scanned by a ton of cameras.
there's a special place in hell for people that post videos as gifs and with no sound.
"I can't remember which game had this when I was younger. But it was on point...looked like a 13 year old head on the body of a 40 year old, ex-military, trained killer."
I want to face scan myself as my skyrim character.
"[Here's a link to the reaction. Have a nice day!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZccLD0--Ag)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*Sourcing here;*  *^(for those to whom it concerns)*

>!I couldn't find the clip on his twitch account, and this looks like it was originally a clip. If anyone has better sourcing, throw it at me so I can update it.!<"
"Well if black mirror has taught me anything, his consciousness was duplicated as well."
Perfect Dark on N64 was supposed to have this using the Gameboy camera.
What game is this?
"In 9 straight years of 2k, trying at least 20 times all the years that had face scan. I've never gotten mine to look anything more than an hgh ridden 8 year old man baby."
"Dude, have a face so generic that it's one of the presets without being face scanned, get on my level üòÇ. Male Commander Shepard's default is my face if I trimmed my beard."
"Whenever face scans come up, I always have to mention the legend, Squeeeeeeps Ramsey:

https://youtu.be/4LgUQyQcn0w"
"Absolutely, for sure, NOT a PR stunt ... nope, fully legit. LMAO"
This reminds me of the time I facescanned myself into NBA live 18 and my character looked massively autistic.
Everytime I try to do the face scan in any game that offers it it never works for me.
Man this new cyberpunk is looking crazy
"You didnt even use the audio, shame"
You could do this with Tony Hawk Underground on PS2. You had to upload a picture to a website though. Some of the monstrosities I created will haunt me for the rest of my life.
I‚Äôd be trippin
This feature should be in more RPGs
When I tried the face scan it just turned my characters face super dark black and looked awful :(.
Meanwhile my manager in FM19 looks like my left ass cheek on wallfare.
"I love RPGs but always have to wait forever before actually starting one because my wife insists on making all my characters. And let me tell you, she nails it. She makes some of my characters look almost exactly like me, it's crazy. My mass effect 2 character was 95% similar to me."
is that Andrew Yang
This is not good for ugly people.
What game is that?
Literally the only entertaining thing in the entire game.
When you realize that the game your playing is supporting the world's most immoral corporation in the games industry.
Hes so giddy and I love it!  Christmas face!
"Here is another one 
https://streamable.com/n8kec?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app"
Why take away from this by turning it into a gif?
"Why do you read into shit so much boys, he‚Äôs happy he got into the game, obviously it‚Äôs not like he used his phone app"
I want the audio to this so bad lol!! Is he choking there in the beginning??
It helps that his face already looked like a character customization option.
"He probably made this game in his past life, and then he was like, ‚ÄúHmm, maybe if i made myself the starting character then i might remember me! Genius!‚Äù"
Pvc says otherwise
What's the game? And who's the YouTuber?
At first I thought the facecam was CGI as well. It looked kinda plastic-y.
Deja Vuuuuuuuuuu
"I just really, really, really wish you could change the voice on your custom dude. Because it reaaaaaaaaaaally doesn't fit for me."
Does this exist with audio?
"Oooooooooooooo, double vision"
"Lol looks like that dude from the ""Diddy Stare Down Gif"" lol."
Did this on Fifa 13? Looked like a flat faced evil moleman
What game is it though?
He got facescanned into the game
"So uh, is there a version with sound?"
seems like the game makers know their target audience well
EA used to have a simple facescan and it worked really well.  I can never figure out why they got rid of it.
My guy on UFC looks pretty realistic also.
But what about in game? I have been burn't too many times making a sweet character only to get into the game and find my skin colour is fucked eg really bright/dark or just a weird.
Lmao
Neat
Bruh
Which game is this
"Ive tried to scan my face with the app and it doesnt work for me. The first time, my face looked like it had dark mud all over it.

The next 5 times ive tried, it gets to 70% and then fails. I try to redo it and it says there are no scans on file. So i have to keep scanning my face. 

Anyone have any ideas?"
Happened to me in NHL 17 without the face scan
wow what is that game?
"My buddy and I just started playing Rust.  Since there is no character creator, you‚Äôre stuck with the random one you‚Äôre given.

My buddy does his first.. he‚Äôs like okay, I‚Äôm a male at least.  Since he prefers playing make characters.

I do mine... it looks EXACTLY like me.  Hair colour, beard, way too white, exactly."
Yea that didn't even register on my 2k19.
Which game tho?
It's called a camera
Since the game has always been the same they've been putting a lot of work into head customization
We should strive to get to a point where this is the experience for all players using some sort of face scanning feature.
How does he not even know to turn off auto focus of his cam while streaming...
I just tried the face scan app last week and it gave me black face. I am as white as it comes.
Why would you want to run around in a video game as you? I play video games to escape me. üòÇ
I miss the 2k17 Taz Glitch man
what game is this...?!?
/r/interestingasfake
I've face-scanned myself into these games before.  It's more impressive than you'd think but still shitty.  Not surprised that 2K specifically did this one for him.
Why would I want a character that looks like me? I don't like looking like me in real life as it is.
The lack of Black hairstyles in most RPGs really is crazy considering how customizable everything else is.
"True. I remember my brother and I trying this shit when it was first introduced (forget which 2K, I don't play em and there's too many anyways). I borrowed a friends PS4 camera, a few lamps to get the lighting just right, some blackout curtains for a make shift studio, and the monstrosity we created that day will haunt me for the rest of my life."
"The big ones weren‚Äôt just facescanned, they got entire body scans like the actual players get"
So this is a fake reaction or something then?
"really? that's pretty cool, it looks great!

this is basketball right?"
So really not at all customization...
boy that sure seemed too exact to be a coincidence.
"Did it with Madden, dont know why they took it out. Guess well see it again on the 2021 version as a new feature."
">scan quality: above average


I would *love* to see a below average one"
"The side view killed me!

I love how it started resembling a face with some holes in it, then just got a bit crooked, and then at the very last moment the game just gave up and erased the majority of it"
Lol that was fkn hilarious
"""Scan quality: Above Average"""
r/contagiouslaughter
My man out here lookin like SCP-173
"Oh hey, I didn't know ""monkey Jesus"" threw hoops"
This was by far the funniest fucking one in the thread. my sides. god damn. lol
Nice to see a fellow Goldy fan
Can confirm: also cry laughed just now
This should be illegal. I almost died!
The side profile absolutely killed me.
"That made my day, thanks dude!"
"Holy shit please make it stop, I‚Äòm dying!"
"Oh God, that's the second one I've seen in this thread so far. They're killing me man, this shit is fantastic!"
"I almost choked on a piece of bread laughing, I'm going to have to arrest you for attempted murder by extremely funny video."
What the hell is even that!!?
Damn this might honesty be some of the funniest shit I‚Äôve ever seen
His reaction made my day.
That was fucking Golden dude
Thanks for linking this his I legitimately cried from laughter
"Just makes me wonder what the hell happened while it was computing his face, did the computer just say ""fuck you you're ugly as FUCK"""
"Amazing. I wept with laughter, as promised. Thank you!"
"Never saw this until right now. God damn, that‚Äôs funny. I tried to hold out but when he starts dying, I can‚Äôt hold it in. Hahaha thanks stranger!"
Opened this before going into the gym and literally was crying laughing in my car before going in. Thank you for sharing
Holy fuck I wasn't prepared for that. My sides hurt.  I needed that too.  Badly.
"Oh my gosh, thank you so much, I laughed so hard I peed myself a little bit"
That's definitely a Bart!
This looks like Zombie Gregor Clegane without the mask
fucking hell this thing is making copies like Annihilation
That‚Äôs what we‚Äôre about find in Area 51

"*Constantly moving around and putting hand on face*

*Scan turns out shit*

*Pikachu face*"
They used a predictive algorithm that showed what his kids are going to look like.
Thank you for sharing! My girlfriend and I literally just cried laughing watching this
Hmm maybe don't hold your face when it's trying to scan you...?
Or [this](https://youtu.be/4LgUQyQcn0w) moment at 3:20
[Here's](https://youtu.be/lc-Z2JA8IWc?t=59) another funny and horrifying one.
[video](https://youtu.be/4LgUQyQcn0w?t=188)
monstrosity? pure art is what that was
"The worse one was when they did it in rainbow 6, Gavin and Geoff ü§£"
Yeah I read Gordon instead of Geoff and now I really want to know how Gordon Ramsey ended up in a game and how he'd react.
How dare you talk about Squeebs like that!
Holy shit.. I just remembered that. Oh my god.
Swear to god Jack jumped from my least to my actual favourite Achievement Hunter just from his contagious laughter throughout the years. Prime example.
Man I read Gordon Ramsey and sped through the video. Geoff works as well though
God I love achievement hunter. Been watching them when they first started red versus blue on rooster teeth. Its amazing how far they have come.

"Omg I literally have it copied in my phone cuz I was just about to link it! 

It‚Äôs [this](https://youtu.be/4LgUQyQcn0w) at 3:20"
"When they did rainbow 6 with face scan too, Gavins was probably the best, just the constant look of shock"
Or xQcs surprise blackface.
Wouldn't it look better if he'd actually held still and didn't joke the whole time?
"OMG, my friends Mii was so accurate he ended up using it as his online photo for the next ten years!"
"This reminds me of that time I started playing Wii fit. I didn't play it for a few months and went back to it, but had gained a few pounds, and it made my Mii fat"
"> Ended up looking like Peter Griffin

I mean seeing we don't know what you look like, this could be bang on accurate."
"Hey Lois, I'm a Mii. Mehehehheheh"
Hehehe freakin' sweet
My friend took a pic of his dick and it was a bald guy we named Richard
"Yep, I did it and it gave me the fattest fucking head with eyes similar to ET"
their
"I tried 5 times to scan my head with my phone doing the camera pan slowly like it instructed in a well lit room. And every single time it came back completely off, color skewed or just didn't upload at all. And the mobile app you need to do it with is fucking TERRIBLE. It's like 300mb and it tries SO hard to force you to play their card based loot box mobile game instead of do the only thing you actually downloaded it for. You have to play through the tutorial and always get bombarded with mobile game shit before you can get to the face scanner which is hidden like 3 menus deep in the app. 

Fuck 2k. Their games get worse every year and it's fucking bullshit you need to connect to a server before you can play their games at all now. I couldn't believe that I was unable to play 2k16 at all in 2018. I had the game for like a year and a half. I'm never wasting money on another 2k installment. I spent $3 on this version when the sale hit and that was too much. And now they're already releasing a new version of the same exact game next year with a roster update and adding WNBA players nobody asked for. Wonder how long this year's version is playable for."
I spent hours trying to facescan myself into one of the Tony Hawk games with the damn EyeToy. That thing was so incredibly picky about lighting.
"Dude the eyetoy was my shit, I could wash that damn window like no other."
"DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUDE

&#x200B;

I forgot about that shit. Those games were honestly some of the most fun I think I've actually ever had with video games. That or it's just the nostalgia speaking, but I distinctly do remember playing it an insane amount then it got knocked off our TV and broke or something like that."
Dude I remember a camera game I got for the gameboy color... the resolution was ass but my 6 year old mind was blown.
MLB the show anyone?
">We've come a long ways from the ~~ps2 eyetoy~~ **Gameboy Camera**.

FTFY"
Good old EyeToy! Not only were the games pretty fun but it actually doubled as a pretty decent webcam for me for a few years.
I wish the sims games could be even more advanced I feel like it's good at making certain people accurate and not others.
Apparently not all that creepy. This person was scanned in person at the 2k studios using the same tech they use for mo cap i guess? Which explains the really accurate rendering.
NBA2K19
It has to be. That dude is a YouTuber who‚Äôs was flown out by 2k and had his face officially scanned. I will say that the regular face scan that‚Äôs available to the public isn‚Äôt that bad. My myplayer is pretty accurate
"Lol how bad do you wanna hear this dude yell?

I promise you're not missing any captivating dialog."
Oblivion had some very in depth character customization. So did one of the wrestling games. I don't remember the name but it had stone cold Steve Austin in it
I don't. I don't want to see my face on my avatar as I summon 1000 children to fight a giant.
"We get it, you know how to format Reddit posts."
"I don't want to be pedantic, but since you're obviously trying to take care to write properly I want to point out that it should be either ""for those whom it concerns"" or ""to whom it concerns"", not both rolled into one."
god you're annoying
"His reaction is r/bettereveryloop material.  IDC if he was scanned in or not, that's a genuine reaction there."
Maybe it is time to buy a mirror...
"Considering he was modeled after one of the most famous male models in history, I‚Äôm gonna just press x ‚Äúdoubt‚Äù on that statement."
Show us.
I also look like famous generic man Mark Vanderloo who definitely isnt a super sexy model or anything.
Male Shepards default face is based on a male model... So.. definitely above average my dude
Uhhhh that‚Äôs quite a statement to make. We‚Äôre going to need you to prove it.
Greetings Shepard Commander
Fuckin bet.
Sure
Holy shit that was beautiful!
"sir, thank you"
I have some bad news for you...
Same with mine. It looks like something exploded in front of my face and left me scorched.

No. My league is very entertaining.
Jesus this painted a depressing picture of the author in my head...
"*puts on Tinfoil Hat* 

I wonder if they are storing that face scan data anywhere.."
lol hes a twitch streamer they all act like that every second theyre on camera
That‚Äôs the sound of all the money EA is sending him through the mail
"The first time I tried this was on Rainbow Six Vegas 2 (it was even an achievement to get it to work). It took way too long and when it finished, I looked like a giant baby running around"
My black cousin facescanned himself into the game and put his black face on a white body.
So in fifa like 15 or 16 they had this fsce scan thing for online create a pro play. One of our teammates found out you can use any image really as long as the proportions are right and its properly sized. The strangest one was a picture of stalin non colorized. Looked pretty sketchy in game like a picaso painting of him lol.
That was 2K15. 2K19's is better but it's still kinda shifty. 2K15's facescans were a [new level of bad](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1GCEU_en-GBAU828AU828&biw=1368&bih=770&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=PN8pXY6vHcKS9QO8t6K4BA&q=2k15+face+scans&oq=2k15+face+scans&gs_l=img.3..0i7i30j0i7i5i30j0i8i7i30.45924.46160..46243...0.0..0.187.187.0j1......0....1..gws-wiz-img.1jL89mUa-rc#imgrc=_) lol
Its moments like that where you question you're self perception. I was in an art class one day and we were practicing portraits of each other. The guy that drew me was very strong with faces and hair but no so well with ~~proton~~ proportions. He drew my features flawlessly but squished my head a little too narrow. For a good 15 minutes during the critique I was freaking out about why my head was so freakishly narrow and no one told me about it and why no one was mentioning it during the critique. Everyone was praising on his strong stuff so I figured he just drew it as he saw it. Until the instructor finally pointed it out and I had a sigh of relief.
Ed.. ward?
Eat sports had this in like nhl 2000 where you could facemap a pic of yourself.
A mirror?
"He had me in the first half, not going to lie."
That didn't end the way I was expecting.
Your parents probably fell the same
I laughed
Modern Frankenstein
"Anyone else remember using the PlayStation 1 eye toy, or whatever it was called, to literally glue an image of your face to your sister in Tony hawk? Lol"
I think I did it on like tony hawks underground or something where you took a pic with the crappy ps2 camera and it literally just painted that on your character‚Äôs head. It was hideous.
Aww you can‚Äôt be THAT ugly. Go easy on yourself
"You could do this with the eye toy on Ps2 for I think it was a tony hawk game and because I was lol a idiot 12 year old going through puberty I took a picture of my dick and called my guy dick face. 

That character looks more like me then the fucking 2K myplayer scan."
"Oh my god, i remember my guy just straight up had a hole in his chin, i have no idea how but he did."
"I *think* the first ever use of this was on the PS2 for either one of the Tony Hawk games or one of the wrestling games, and it looked absolutely god awful."
Mine is still my Twitter pic
From the way this reads I thought you were going to say you made an epic match.
Hey now im sure you're not ugly
"There used to be this poker game on Xbox 360, they must have used some off-the-shelf character generator and they didn't put any limits on it.

my brother and I spent hours crafting the most tragically horrible creatures on there, it was unbelievably funny."
"The face scan software that they give us is absolute ass. He was scanned into the game at the actual 2k studios, that's why it looks so good. I've tried face scanning too and it's horrifying lol"
Sounds like any photo of me...  ever.
"That‚Äôs weird, your mom says the same thing about you..."
I used my iPhone and it looked pre close to me
Didn‚Äôt you learn anything from Full Metal Alchemist? Human transmutations forbidden!
This should be where dating profile pics come from.
"You're talking about when you do it by yourself though, this guy was actually flown down by 2K Sports to the game studio and scanned in by 2K, they did it with big YouTubers who stream their game, that's why it looks so good."
Ed... ward
So it was pretty accurate then?
Now you know how your mom feels
"[Dramatic rendition.](https://i.imgur.com/Tu3IvTw.gif) Also, did it cost an arm and a leg?"
"I turned out black on 2k, and blue on ufc. I'm white lol"
"Entire body, you say?"
"I don't think so, just surprised by the face scan accuracy (is my guess)"
"Yeah I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a fake reaction, all the 2k youtubers are these over the top, clickbait, ‚Äúyo yo smash that like button‚Äù type guys"
I don't watch the dude but I imagine I'd still get pretty hyped seeing myself accurately put into a video game for the first time even if I knew it was going to happen.
"He is a streamer, all of his reactions are overexaggerated for entertainment value"
"Come on you wouldn't be thrilled & excited to see what it looked like if you got it done, then surprised when it looked that good?  Or are you just dead in side from too many years of Redditing like the rest of us?"
probably. everything in media is fake. it's how corporations sell products to morons who believe everything they see. Besides it wouldn't surprise me if this 'influencer' was scanned in specifically by 2k and not a typical user experience which is why it's so accurate.
"Yeah it‚Äôs nba 2k.

It looks cool for him I guess haha, 2k just make sure the youtubers are happy because the game is heavily pay 2 win, full of ads and microtransactions so we get screwed over for loving basketball unfortunately."
"yes, this is basketball"
Have you uou seen camera-generated Miis?

I used to watch him all the time but kinda stopped following his streams when I got busy with school 4 years ago. Is he still streaming at all?

Didn't you hear him talk about it picking up the green screen? Do you see a green screen near him?"
"It looks like him, but partially melted."

It honestly does look like him just a bald version

Glad I'm not the only one.  I was sadly disappointed.
The pictures were already taken before that point in the video. That was just the game trying to figure out what to do with the pictures they took and uploaded.

"There was gonna be a feature in perfect dark to use the GB camera and the GB connect kit (from pokemon stadium) to do face scans for multiplayer. I think they pulled it cause the columbine shooting was still fresh in everyone's minds and letting kids put their faces into a Nintendo fps was probably a bad idea, marketing wise.

I can't imagine it would work well either, based off the resolution and CPU power of the N64(tho it probably just treats it as a flat texture, and wraps it over the head model.)"
"I can live with the level of detail we have for faces, but it drives me crazy that we can't adjust height, head size, or arm/leg length."

"I did this on Xbox 360 with their camera, turned out great in a hilarious way. I pulled a scowling Max Payne type of face and would spend the match growling about how much I hated terrorists. Good times."

Mine looked just like me but with a Michael Jackson nose.
My roommate and I spent like 4 hours trying to get it to accept our Darth Vader head cookie jar.  It eventually worked but it looked horrible
I was George Bush in Vegas 2 ole google images just doesnt do the trick no more...
Hahahhh yesssss wore that and the custom camo you get when you hit the soft level cap
Oh the memories. Me and my friends spent waaaaay too many hours on Vegas 2 making ridiculous faces for our characters. Loved that game with a passion though. Terrorist hunt was the bomb.
I did this in the same game. Had a huge smile on my face so I could stop and look at the bodies before they respawned. Good times.
Still looked better than Gavin free I bet

"Once upon a time worked for Xbox testing the dashboard. One of the things we had to do was make sure the console features didn't break update to update. So I spent a good amount of time verifying the Xbox Vision Camera worked. For the technology, some games weren't super terrible. Basically just took your photo and wrapped it around a default model. 

Wasn't tons of fun but better than having to make sure Football Manager 2008 still worked, which required playing at least one game of Multiplayer. Do you know how long it takes to find another person on the 360 playing Football Manager and looking for a game?"
"So, you are saying it was accurate?"
I used the full Arctic camo with George W Bush's face. Nothing like crushing people on CQC with W.
I became very Asian. It was hilarious.
You've just uncovered my memories of playing that game as Hitler
My buddy made the most serious face and he looked like woody from toy story. Funniest shit watching him peek around corners
"God, I remember those days. I remember playing games with Hitler and the Joker"
"Man, I didn't realize how much I missed the multiplayer in Vegas.."
"Wow, I forgot about that game having that feature.  When I tried it I ended up with a mix between a blue alien face and Michael Myer's mask."
To be fair the stupid shit scans in V2 were awesome.  I played a game with what can only be described as a Tactical Blue Man Group.
I remember running into some guy who did it on Rainbow Six Vegas 1 and he had his eyes bulging out of his head his teeth gritted with what looked like blood around his mouth and all he did for the entire match was breathe heavily into the mic like when the blue jellyfish called spongebob.
Oh my god what a game that was

Maybe he just hasn't unlocked that character yet?

Yes! And I was a kid so I didn't know how to import pictures so I just fucked around with the parameters and ended up making this abject horror who had a blue hole in his face.

Especially the butthole

"To shreds, you say?"
Apparently he got scanned at 2K headquarters. It should be good!
Isn't that pretty much all youtubers?
when the entire meta of the game is abusing glitches and exploits what do you expect.
"Yeah, those reactions are fake"
"Yeah but 99.9% of the over the top YouTube personalities are like that because they're putting on a completely fake persona, meaning the reactions are entirely fake, even when they come from genuine shock they're pretty much immediately made fake.

It's all patrickstewardacting.gif"
"To be fair, I would be hype to see the results of my professional face scan."
"Pause. Be clearer. The my team and my career modes are pretty much pay to win. Outside of that, MyLeague is where it is at and where most real basketball fans and gamers utilize. I didn‚Äôt get screwed over for loving basketball, I will get screwed over if i engage in those modes that are pay to win."
"oh well that sucks.. find another publisher maybe?

is that the one with the 99 euro player?"

">Also having to stay online while playing single player?

i'm just now getting back into gaming, pretty much missed out on the last gen of consoles and am finally buying a ps4 --- this idea of having to be online while playing a game, a fucking single player game, is the most insane concept i think  i have ever heard of in relation to video games.

&#x200B;

it's just so goddamn absurd it's hard to wrap my head around it.

edit: also it's a bit elitist and generally shitty because a *ton* of people live in rural areas with absolutely deplorable internet options. i'm talking Directv-shitty internet and the like. basically dealing with a fancy version of dialup or pay obscene fees to use their phone as a hotspot/wifi. sorry i had to rant, lived in rural midwest for years and years with basically no internet. fuck these companies that just assume everyone in America has Google Fiber.

"This is why Doctor Mike on YouTube for his Doctor Reacts series says if you're ever in an emergency situation, instead of just saying ""call 911"" point directly at someone and say ""You, call 911!"" Because that direct Call to Action overpowers mob mentality and the bystander effect. It's all based around psychology, and social responses to perceived human interaction. By saying ""Like, comment, subscribe"" they are directly calling you, the viewer, to action, and triggering your brain to perceive that as an interaction"

"Also I've heard from YouTubers from behind the scenes that YouTube's algorithms also track that and if you're not trying hard enough to promote your channel, it can threaten the monetization of your channel. I'm no YouTuber myself so I can't verify 100% but I could see that. The more battle like they can make it, the more they stand to gain through traffic figures.

"He could easily break his fucking arm with that axe. The ""shield"" wouldn¬¥t do much shit if the ""trainer"" would go on with full power."
Weird I didn‚Äôt expect the ax to do exactly what is was designed to do.
"Is that a freaking [Black Sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sun_\(symbol\)) carved on the axe?

> The black sun (German: Schwarze Sonne) is a symbol employed in a post-Nazi Germany context by neo-Nazis and some occult subcultures, such as Satanism. The symbol first occurs as a design element in a castle remodeled and expanded under Heinrich Himmler during Nazi Germany. The symbol's design consists of twelve radial mirrored sig runes, symbols employed as a logo by the Schutzstaffel. All subsequent forms extend from this mosaic. Whether the symbol had a name or held any particular significance among the SS remains unknown. Its association with the occult concept of the ""black sun"" (and therefore also its name) developed from the influence of a popular German novel first published in 1991.


EDIT : Thanks to /u/letstalkaboutvex , this is apparently a ""Kolovrat"", a Slavic symbol with more or less the same connotations. So, instead of Germanic Neo-nazi, i guess it's a Slavic Neo-nazi."

It was just an axe in dent
At least he's getting some exercise.
Well that was stupid.
Why would you use a real axe? You can get a training one for like $20 on amazon.
Why was the axe real though

Must have been a rude surprise for any medieval guy running into battle with a home-made wood shield.

EDIT: Looks like it's a Slavic kolovrat, their version of a swastika and a pagan symbol for the sun. It can sometimes see modern usage by neo-Nazi groups."
Great. The guy finally has some exercise and it's ruined immediately by a moron that tries to look like a tough guy.

Could someone please put some pressure on that wound and stop just looking at it??
It‚Äôs NSFL because it shows a little blood and a small cut?
I bet that trainer has a little dick
I get the impression that your trainer is just a dude who had a space for a gym and then gave himself a blackbelt.
What a shitty trainer to let you do that with such a crap shield.

I can only imagine how bad that room stinks.
Dude has the slavic version of the Black Sun engraved on his axe but looks like the poster child of the nazi untermensch
Is that made of cardboard or something
Fuckin larpers.
"A shield is not actually meant to stand there and take a blow, it is meant to be used for deflecting a blow. 

Using a shield also takes some skill. You never want to just stand there and take the full impact of a blow, you want to guide the blow away from you.

Same idea as to why helmets are rounded and not a box, it helps deflect the blow, mitigating damage."
Just because you run a gym doesn't make you smart.
"Um yeah, your not supposed to use actual weapons that are sharp....... .."
"Those sheilds are better at deflecting glancing blows by holding it with its edge pointed toward your opponent. If you hold it at a right angle to the blade, you are gonna have a bad time."
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN USE A SHARP HATCHET

It didn't take long before he got banned."

His trainer is an ultimate hardo
"Laughed RIDICULOUSLY hard at ""Nerf club and flimsy balsa wood shield"".   
In my warped mind I saw the Nerf club doing bouncy ball type boing-boings off everything it touched... complete with cartoon spring sounds.... naturally.   And the balsa wood shield? Each time it was struck by the ax, it obviously exploded, but fell into perfectly packaged, boxed toothpicks.  

This either indicates there's something wrong with me.. orrrrr I have a wicked sense of humor. Not sure."

Also probably shouldn‚Äôt have used a sharpened axe for sparring
Don't forget flipping and twirling the axe around a lot more than he did! A true expert would spin that thing around at least 50 times before attacking
"If he were a real trainer/expert, he wouldn't be fucking with axes in the first place. The axe fad needs to die off already."
You mean him flipping the axe 10 times then wildly flailing it around doesn't give you confidence in his skills??

Horrible idea from the start.

Not really much of a shield but looks good on a wall."
Its plywood and fabric. It's really basic LARP gear. Meant to defend against foam swords. Also it can't weigh over a certain amount just in case you hit someone with it. (Using it as a weapon is against the rules)
This is the first shield you find in all RPGs.
But you have heard of it!
It's probably really strong against dark magic or offers a buff to stamina or something.
You mean you don't like his homemade cardboard captain america shield?

Let me ax you a question.
Looks like he sharpened it recently too.
"It's a little concering to see a black sun engraved onto the weapon.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Sun_(symbol)"
Quite literally the sharpest tool in the shed.
Why weren't they using a real shield for that?
"you don't practice for medieval combat with real weapons? peasant. get on my level or gtfo

  #knighthood #nobleclass"
So Americans?
Seems correct. Both think they're the greatest thing after hot water.
Red is for Russian?
With the NSFL tag I was full on expecting the trainer to kill the man.
I‚Äôm sure those shields were the shit.... 1000 years ago for blocking a couple arrows semi usefully.
"I mean, the shield was trash. There should be no way for the axe to go through. Imagine a full power swing. He could break his arm with that even through this crappy shield."
"It's a ""[Kolovrat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swastika#Slavic)"", which is not a Black Sun but is, more or less, a Slavic version of the Swastika, and is commonly used by Slavic far-right groups."
That was the first thing I noticed.. Fucking terrifying to see someone with that engraved into a weapon and being swung around with such an itching make contact.
"Yes, the Venn diagrams of Russian vaguely (weekend) white pride dumbasses and Russian martial arts / survivalist / knives / vigilante shit enthusiasts are overlapping a great amount. Alternatively it may be vaguely white pride nationalist soccer fans. There are even some things that I want to buy but can't because their logos are obviously flirting with all that shit.

This kind of thing has Pagan / back to the roots associations in Russia (Kolovrat, cult of the Sun, invented ethnography) as much as it is an obvious edgy stand-in for swastikas."
"It is kolovrat (spinning wheel), ancient pagan slavic symbol."
"Makes sense, I do get a whole behold the master race vibe from them"
"Holy shit, I was scrolling down the thread thinking ""is nobody else going to point out the neo-nazi symbol?""

Not to stereotype or anything but the guys in the video look 100% the type. I wonder what subreddits they post on?"
tis but a flesh wound.....
"Don‚Äôt feel like axin‚Äô, axin‚Äô!"
There's no bleeding in my dojo !
"Just lick it up, it‚Äôs an appetizer"
"It's a viking style ""Bearded Axe"".

The actual reason for the shape was to hook over the opponents shield and pull it down, exposing their face.

The shield is all wrong though. Viking shields were circular but they did not have the strap. Instead they had a vertical handle along the back and a metal thing called a ""boss"" which protected the hand and would have prevented this injury entirely, even if the axe split the shield like it did here.

The reason the axe put the shield so easily is because the wood grain of the shield was also wrong. It should have been horizontal, not vertical.

Edit: autocorrect

Edit 2: lol I just realized you where only asking about the symbol. It's not any real Viking symbol that I know of. Probably just a modified Aegishjalmur, ""The Helm of Awe and Terror""."
"lol I said this exact thing to my friend a few minutes ago.

> ""Saw this without sound, was wondering wtf that could happen...turned on sound, 
""BLYAT""
oh ok"""
It's like Florida except colder and more Russiany
"No he didn't. I do want to know the extent of his injuries. It looks like a clean cut, but with the impact of the ax it can fracture or chip off bone and shred tendons which is going to cause long term damage."
"So you actually believe a reasonable person should assume nothing could go wrong when you agree to defend yourself against a real metal axe with a fake shield? Shit dude, go try it yourself and please record it. :)"
Trainer logic: bring a sharp axe to a training fight
Cardboard and duct tape shields
Or any fucking axe. When's the last time in the past 200 years someone's been attacked by an axe and just happened to have a shield handy?
"Also he didn't even seem concerned to have wounded this ""training partner"".  That's a red flag for me dog."
A-axe fad? What axe fad do you speak of?!
What wrong with it?
AX NEVER DIE
"i mean having fancy (but useless) skills isn't bad, not using protective gear or foam/plastic replicas is the big problem"
"Well, he did win"
"Im more concerned with his mentality. A sane, compassionate human would immediately run to his aid and apologize profusely. That dude just smirked and walked away."
I have enough confidence in his skills that I would run away if he was coming down a dark alley swinging his axe at me.
And waddling around like his diaper was full.
"Maybe the idea is to get cut, so when someone asks him about the scar he can say that he got it in an axe fight."
"you can, if you are skilled and use proper protective gear and more blunt edges"
Also because axes were a lot more common and less expensive than a sword.  And can also do a pile of useful stuff beyond kill people.  And better rewards strength over skill.  And takes much less skill to use effectively.  And...
less nerds more like idiots.
"That ""nerd"" is MMA fighter Maxim ""Mad Max"" Novoselov.  More idiotic, less nerdy."
Man I'm as nerdy as it gets and I would never swing a weapon at someone. Those dudes are just morons.
It could probably stop an arrow at an incredible distance

"> Wicker shield.

Almost as bad as a wicker toilet."
"Wicker shields were historically very useful, and were used by many skirmish style infantry in ancient civs, especially in the Mediterranean. Greeks, Persians, Assyrians, all used a few variations. There were rather large cane shields that were used as arrow protection for skirmishers. Notably, smaller wicker shields backed by rawhide were used by the Persian Immortals for close quarters combat. 

This shield, however, looks like the strongest part is the felt covering"
They need to fix Larp man. Bring back realistic battle tactics. The shield bash is a staple of any shield bearer.
"It's not even LARP gear, it's decoration. Even lightest touch games have a chance of snapping that thing."
The axe on the other hand looks quite real and recently polished/sharpened.  Truly amazing.
Somehow rats drop these in the first dungeon. Worth 2 gp at the shop in the starting town.

"Yeah.
Worst case scenario, he could never move his hand the way he used to."
In the end it does kind of look like his arm is broken
He received 10 stitches and diabetes
"Experienced trainer: Always wear protection for sparring! Even a plastic sword can give you a nasty concussion! And never use sharpened weapon for training!

That's a recipe for the front to fall off.

"I‚Äôm willing to argue that any axe has a good chance at fucking up someone with a shield seeing as an axe can hook and pull.

From my understanding shields were meant for defending against pole arms, projectiles, swords, etc.

Axes stylistically are the counter for shields. If someone is a HEMA nerd please correct me"
He was far too worried about looking cool for the camera to be concerned for the well-being of the sparring partner
Happy cake day!
Axe-throwing places have gotten big recently in some areas.
"Well Axe sparring is dangerous compared to say swordfighting. Even if this axe was a training axe(made out of weighted plastic) or a blunted sparring one, the blunt trama from an axe can cause problem even if you are wearing protective gear. If you're legitimately sparring you want to throw your whole muscle and weight into a strike, and with weapons that can cause a lot of blunt trauma like an axe or a mace that can be dangerous.

However, I believe what that other poster was referring to was the new trend of axe-throwing. You can see a few videos of people almost killing others by doing it wrong on various subreddits."
But it‚Äôs Russia
"Well one of them was using foam/plastic replicas, that's a start."

Yeah when it's thrown....
"If the guy firing that arrow is far enough away for this shield to stop it and he is still hitting you, you are fucked."
Not from a longbow... No chance
It also repels dragons.
It's bulletproof at a distance exceeding the range of the bullet.

It's all fun until you concuss the ears off an elf; then it's funny too.
They have real LARP. But those guys wear steel armor because they‚Äôre not complete idiots.
"There is a scale to these kind of games.  Some games are interactive story telling where the gear is just for show.  Some story telling systems are lightest touch, where the gear needs only a minimum amount of safety.  Most of those LARPs are local and have local rules.  

The next level has more combat but often less roleplaying, Amtgard and Bico fall into this level.  Combat happens and the foam equipment is safe for that level of combat.

Beyond that is the medieval combat sports, where combat is emphasized over storytelling.  Dagorhir, Belagarth, SCA.  The first 2 pad the weapon, and use foam equipment.  SCA pads the person and uses steel armor and wood equipment.

beyond that there is stuff like HEMA and BON, that are just about martial ability.

There is somthing for everyone, based on what they actually want to do."
Look up SCA.
"I dunno, most wall hanger shields I've seen are built better than that. seems reasonable that it was purposefully built to be light. Or he made it himself."

But the dudes who are into melee weapons are usually obese so he‚Äôs probably not doing this for fitness. Especially with such a short match.

"Yep, this will keep you arrow safe at 1 mile or greater"
Shit myself laughing at this.
"No, like that split second just before the arrow hits the ground. I think that shield could stop that arrow with ease."
Or shot by Lars Andersen.
"Shield of Mir√∂r a plate of glass that deflects 100% of the damage from any one attack, then shatters into a tricky trap of broken glass on the floor. Impervious to fire, water, heat and cold attacks. Good for tricky escapes.

edit: I love this idea


Shield of shit: a shield made of thin wood, intended to be placed into the ground using sharp spikes when used. Traps bladed weapons and arrows inside itself. Bludgeoning weapons and attacks simply break the shield, useable only once.

Armor of l√∂g: very thick wood affixed to the outside of player's normal armor, catches arrows and blades with ease and is much too thick to chop through. Magic and well placed swords easily cut through the gaps in the l√∂g. Arrows and blades caught in the armor can be reused by the wearer.

glass cannon: not a cannon, it's a sword made of glass intended to shatter on shields and helmets, breaking into thousands of peices upon impact, spreading through the weak points in armor such as eye holes, plate gaps, or skin. Can also be used as a normal sword, only it breaks off inside an enemy, doing internal damage as he moves around and has a chance of limb paralysis. Useable only once.

The broken lance: Spear made of glass, when the end is used as a weapon, it break off, leaving a shorter spear with the tip remaining just as sharp, meaning you can leave several spear ""heads"" in the enemy with a single weapon. The spear is also hollow so as to allow blood to leave the enemy with a spearhead still inside them. (think of a similar weapon but like a mechanical pencil instead, sounds awesome) This could also be really weak wood.

Weapon of the valkyries: A sword intended to carve through the opponent using abrasives. The sword is made of a special sand fused together through heat, infused with small metal pins that are easily dislodged, when the blade penetrates a body, peices of it break off inside the target, dealing damage as they move around.

edit2: I thought of more at work 

Whip of permanent punishment: leather whip with serrated metal spikes placed down it's length, intended to quickly wrap up enemies, the spikes sink into their flesh as they struggle through the trap, however the more they move the worse it becomes, similar to a Chinese finger trap.

Be√§ver: a beaver that's very angry it's been stuck inside your pocket for the last 20 days of hiking, attacking and distracting anything, regardless of lvl. The beaver is actually a minor god sent down to judge the players, but stuck in a pocket in its beaver form is unable to do anything. The beaver was bought by the party so it goes on a rampage as soon as it's released, unable to find it's captor.

Staff of R≈ìp: it's a rope, that is also a staff? It's been reinforced with sap from a tree to function as a staff, however as soon as a sword or mace touches this weird weapon watch out. When attacked the staff shatters into a normal rope absorbing the blow and allowing the PC to wrap it around the weapon in question. After use it *magically* transforms back into a rope, at least that's what the guy in the shop told you.

Mace of blinding: a short metal handle with a sturdy glass ball on the end, when >20 damage is dealt the ball shatters and sand is spread all over the receiver of the attack. After the mace is used you have a very sharp metal stick. (alternatively could be a net, trapping the receiver from fleeing, OR MARBLES! so they slip!) 

Drain flesh spear: a hollow barbed metal rod that'd been sharpened on one end, the longer you leave it in the target the more damage it does.

Cone of pine: Extremely flammable ammunition for a slingshot or projectile weapon, at least that's what the guy at the tavern said.

Arrows of drainflesh: literally just the drain flesh spear but in arrow form. (yikes, imagine the buildup of that amount of damage)"
You'd probably get more protection from actual paper mache. They have to make pinatas pretty thin.
Not the bees!
"It's always funny until someone gets hurt, and then it's just hilarious."
Then you tell the cleric to revive him so you can shield bash him again!
Ah what point does it cease being LARP and become just people attacking each other with weapons.
The best thing about SCA is the orgies.
"Seconding the SCA.  It's LARP, but with a historical recreation/research focus.  There are no plotlines and no magic, just a love of history.  Basically a bunch of nerds trying to lean about the middle ages and earlier by doing it, and also we go camping and get drunk after fighting and sharing Arts/Science projects.  

If you can name something done pre-1600 there's probably someone trying to recreate it, and if there isn't there sure as hell are a lot of people with resources and information to help YOU recreate it.  Fencing, armored combat, archery/arrow making, weaving, sewing, cooking, music/instruments, smithing, metal casting, ship building, etc.

It's honestly a surprisingly massive group, with something like 40,000 members worldwide.  If you live in a decently sized city there's probably a group with various activity meetings every week.  Every year Pennsic pulls in over 10,000 attendees for two weeks of camping (although a lot of people dont stay the full 14 days).  It's so big the state of Pennsylvania appoints the camp site it's own post office for the duration of the event.  It's absolutely nuts.

Join the SCA! It's really cool!"
"Even then, it's not meant to defend against foam swords. It's decoration. No foam game is going to allow wood shields without foam covering anyway because it will damage weapons."
"Not only obsidian, flint and chert can cut easily even before any kind of knapping."
"Obsidian would make a rubbish blade, It can be made much sharper than metal but people seem to forget that obsidian is essentially glass and shatters very easily"
"I have never underestimated any of these things. In fact, I‚Äôve never even estimated any of these things."
"Obsidian is sharp yes, but also really brittle and not very suited for wood chopping at all. Stone axes where sturdier than obsidian, but much more blunt."
"Obsidian is sharp but fragile, it breaks and shatters very easily."
"Which is awesome because that's about 1,300,000 years before our species (homo sapiens) hit the scene.  Our ancestors invented knives *before* we evolved into our current form."

I highly recommend joining any kind of group exercise for anyone having the same problem, provided it's somewhere that takes safety seriously."
"Historical european martial arts seems like a pretty fun way to hit the gym, not when you do dumb shit like this, but in general seems like a fun way to acquire useless skills and work out."
"Yea this was in high school, we were in a construction tech class. He was worried about chipping the edge and not thinking at all. After that we had a big discussion about how you let sharp things fall on the ground."
"This. I work in a welding shop, and if something starts to get away from me I just make myself scarce and let it hit the floor. Most of our steel has nasty burrs from the saw, and it'll rip straight through a glove or jacket or pants like it's nothing if it has some momentum to it, not to mention the impact of catching high-speed metal. The ground will catch everything, and damage to any object is preferable to even a risk of an injury."

- Crowd: A witch! A witch! A witch! We found a witch! We've got a witch! A witch! A witch! We have found a witch. May we burn her?
- How do you know she is a witch
- She looks like one.
- Bring her forward.
- I'm not a witch! I'm not a witch !
- But you are dressed as one.
- They dressed me like this. - No, we didn't.
- And this isn't my nose. It's a false one.
- Well? - We did do the nose.
- The nose? - And the hat. But she is a witch !
- Did you dress her up like this? - No, no!
- Yes. A bit.
- She has got a wart.
- What makes you think she's a witch?
- She turned me into a newt!
- A newt?
- I got better.
- Burn her anyway!
- Quiet! Quiet!
- There are ways of telling whether she is a witch.
- Are there? What are they? Tell us. - Do they hurt?
- Tell me, what do you do with witches?
- Burn them!
- And what do you burn, apart from witches?
- More witches! - Wood!
- So why do witches burn?
- 'Cause they're made of wood? - Good!
- How do we tell if she is made of wood? - Build a bridge out of her.
- But can you not also make bridges out of stone?
- Oh, yeah.
- Does wood sink in water?
- No, it floats. - Throw her into the pond!
- What also floats in water?
- Bread. - Apples.
- Very small rocks. - Cider! Great gravy.
- Cherries. Mud. - Churches.
- Lead. - A duck!
- Exactly.
- So, logically--
- If she weighs the same as a duck...
- she's made of wood.
- And therefore?
- A witch!
- A duck! A duck! - Here's a duck.
- We shaIl use my largest scales.
- Burn the witch !
- Remove the supports!
- A witch!
- It's a fair cop.
- Who are you, who are so wise in the ways of science?
- I am Arthur, king of the Britons."
"Good.

Mallet beats testicles.

So in theory it was winnable, he just had to get in early."
Haha yeah I know what you mean. Man manufactured axe to specifically perform that task.
"Yeah, just found that out. Apparently used by Russian Slavic neo-nazis like the Russian National unity."
"And sexy, mind you"
"If someone were to zealously hand you an arrow, this could absorb the minuscule amount of kinetic force, and can then be bent into a basket, such that you could use your former shield to carry around your beloved arrow, fro, and to, and to and fro, as a bad-ass arrow bitch do."
"But wait, he discovered that new technique centuries of archers never figured out. How could he possibly not be a true master?

Historical reenactment (the more combat orientated groups) and BOTN. We wear armour and beat each other up. No foam or 'casting spells' or whatever.
I figure the line in the sand is ‚Äúintent to injure‚Äù

Watch it again.. she says it because it is rigged.. when they take them away the scales can be seen in the background empty and the duck side is way lower than her side

"According to the accounts from the conquistadors one blow.  Also the clubs had the blades spaced fairly wide between each blade, so they could hack in then pull back for some exceedingly nasty wounds.

Just watched it again and the duck is still in the duck side. You can see its head briefly just before the knighting but then his leg covers the head enough it just looks like white cloth.
I don't believe this. I've been hit by a rogue baseball bat and it would have been way worse if it were an axe. The axe bruises and slices and is more likely to break a bone due to concentrating the force on a smaller area.
"I find the Mayans and Aztecs exceedingly interesting.

Going and seeing the ruins is very high on my bucket list."
"Bezopasnost come from root ""opasnost"" - danger, so bezopasnost is absence of danger. 

Security should be translated as ""Ohrana"" which is literally mean ""ones who keep something safe"", for example ""GoHran"" is Big Helluva Russian Government Safe.

Though on some Security jackets you can see word ""bezopasnost"" (and that a probably reason why google translate it such way), it come from tradition to call every secret service branch ""Sluzhba Bezopasnosti"" - literally ""Service which remove dangers"""
"Unfortunately ""I'm here to rescue you"" translates into ""kill everyone in the building"" in Russian"
He certainly did rescue the guy from working out.
"I always assumed that was sarcasm, mocking the fairness of the scales and the entire proceedings as well as a broader commentary on how witchhunts were used to persecute lesbians, outspoken female leaders, or any woman that declined the advances of a man in power."
"Bone breaks aren‚Äôt really the biggest worry though. Concussive force that ruptures internal organs is very hard to repair, whereas an organ that is cut is easier to fix. 

That being said an axe brings a a similar amount of force as a bat so both would suck a lot. But I would way rather be stabbed by a knife than hit by either."
I agree with you because an ax is literally a baseball bat+sword therefore combining the crush and slash murderous effects
"Also read up on the Incans, Xapotec, and various other civilizations that sprang up in the region.  Fascinating stuff, unfortunately no surviving written records apart from stone tablets.  As far as I know, anyways."

"The judge looked at me and my first wife when we were finally in front of her and asked if we were sure we wanted a divorce.  I assume because we were both crying and holding hands.  It was a weird time.

"I remember when my parents went to do this. It was a long, drawn  out process for them, because they had two kids and I guess figuring out custody is a bitch.

"Signing my paperwork was fun.

First my ex was like ‚ÄòI‚Äôm broke, buy me breakfast‚Äô at the courthouse, and I was basically like ‚Äòlol, no.‚Äô

Then she kept asking why I wasn‚Äôt sad and was smiling the whole time. The divorce had dragged out over a couple years because our state is stupid as fuck and the workers lost our paperwork. There was nothing contested.

Then she asked me why I was wearing a tee shirt and jeans. All we were doing was signing off in front of a judge and she was dressed up for the occasion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting dressed up to shoot a dog‚Äù was apparently not what she wanted to hear because she was upset.

I‚Äôm sorry, but when you repeatedly cheat on me over a period of years, don‚Äôt do shit around the house when you don‚Äôt have a job, I do all the yard work and the majority of the housework while you run around on me, then no, I‚Äôm not going to be upset in the slightest.

Edit: Some of y‚Äôall... Please don‚Äôt try and turn this into some justification for your misogynistic bullshit. Shitty people are shitty people regardless of gender."
"Looking back on mine, I wish I would‚Äôve done this. She asked me the day after she graduated from college I had put her through and she didn‚Äôt have to work during. The divorce took like a month as we had no kids and had a lawyer draw up the paperwork. She showed up driving her new bfs car to sign the paperwork and I immediately got upset because I had heard she‚Äôs been cheating on me while I was gone at work. 

Life works itself out and this really is me today. I look at it as probably the best thing she could‚Äôve done to me. My wife now is truly my best friend."
"My ex and I debated on Divorce selfies, but decided his parents would kill us, so we didn't. We filed twice (first time, a few things got rejected and we had to redo it) and both times we went out to lunch after. We make better friends than we did spouses."

"Biggest favor my ex did for me was when she decided to kick me to the curb.  Even with the legal fees and division of marital assets I am financially better off today. Marital law as structured today is a suckers games. After all the smoke and mirrors were in the background I sat down and determined using a simple speadsheet I could have flown to Las Vegas every other weekend, visited a ranch house and would have been better off financially than ever being married."
"My ex-husband and I dropped our daughter off at preschool and our son with his mom, drove  to the courthouse together, got a disillusionment, then went out to breakfast. Sixteen years later we still get along and I text him happy divorciversary every year!
It was the best decision we ever made and although there were a few rough spots over the years, everyone is much healthier and happier."

"Welcome to 2019, where divorce is praised by the reddit internet community."
Am I the only one that thinks stuff like this is trashy?
"My marriage ended after over 20 years, I still kinda consider it as successful.  The kids have asked how we ever got together considering we have absolutely nothing in common.  It was a small town, OK?  Perhaps we should have looked around a bit, but I  can't imagine having better kids, so I'm still sticking with""successful marriage"" even though it ended."
I don't get the joke.

She looks sad and hurt. Without a back story I can't see this as funny.
Me and my ex wife are both happy about our divorce. We‚Äôve managed to stay friends throughout it all as well.
I wish I could be this happy letting someone go
Man I‚Äôve been dealing with a shitty breakup lately (the first one I ever really saw a future with) but all the positive comments about how everyone still managed to find happiness after going through worse than I did gives me hope.
"I've been divorced for like half a year. Glad it's over, glad I get weekends with all 3 kids even though only the smallest is biologically mine. 

But dealing with the ex is stressful. Was threatened to be taken to court and have the 2 older kids taken away because I answered the phone with ""yeah, need some thing?"" and answered a question with ""sure, whatever."""
"You can't get divorced, if you never marry."
"Had a lawyer drinking friend one night at the bar that said he deals with a lot more divorces than you'd expect that are totally amicable, just need some help navigating the courts. One couple sent the guy a fruit basket afterward."
"Yeah, I felt a tremendous amount of relief when I split from my ex-wife. It was a toxic marriage. I got healthy, she didn‚Äôt. She liked to hit and threaten suicide and/or murder, and scream. I was walking on eggshells. It was a bad scene. When I finally left, I felt a wave of relief wash over me unlike anything I ever felt.

The divorce was uncontested. Then the divorce was finalized and that completely fucked me up. I was fine and it was what I wanted. But once it was officially over, the next day I felt all those emotions I hadn‚Äôt felt over the previous year since splitting. I really wanted to stay married, too. It just wasn‚Äôt safe for me to do so and she refused to deal with her issues while I was dealing mine. So much wasted potential. That‚Äôs the saddest part."
"Lol.
If the sexes were reversed then OP would be overwhelmingly celebrated."
"I'm approaching 50 and never married. People think there's something wrong with me. Well, they're right but that only partly explains why I never married. The other part is watching my own parents go through separation (and the effect on the kids, inc. yours truly), watching my friends, neighbours and acquaintance go through marriages and horrible divorces. Fuck that shit!"
Cringe
There is some pain behind those eyes
Attention whore alert!
Not sure if this is funny as much as it is distasteful
Who actually snapchats about something like this and then posts it on reddit? jesus. Glad you're happy. Hope you still aren't super petty.
Yet you still appear salty one year later.
"Felt cute, might get divorced later idk"
Obviously not a happy marriage.
"My ex and I got glared at during a mandatory divorced parents class because we kept whispering, joking, and laughing throughout."
I enjoyed my divorce proceeding. My ex wife and I were there with a dozen divorcing couples.  The judge would make each former couple say how long they were married and we would do a low five whenever someone‚Äôs marriages was shorter than ours.
"I just went through your profile and the timeline of events are amazing. You get your used Fox body stang, life is good. Then comes the divorce. You‚Äôre enthused, she‚Äôs not. Next thing you‚Äôve already got a post-divorce Audi. It‚Äôs just fantastic."
"I couldn't keep the grin off my face when we were in front of the judge and she said she would waive the waiting period for us. We weren't expecting to be divorced that exact day, it was just a status update meeting. I played ""best day of my life"" on full volume as I drove away from the courthouse. Apparently you shouldn't do that when you drove your ex-husband to the courthouse and he's sitting next to you in the passenger seat. Sorry not sorry."
should be in r/funnyandsad
Honestly does anyone else think that these are kinda trashy and childish. I mean everytime I see one of these I assume the woman filed for divorce because shes done putting up with some juvenile shithead.
r/trashy
"Lucky you.

I needed 2 years and a half to cope with the end of my marriage. Having two little kids made it one of my worst moments of my entire life. The only positive thing is that I discovered some dating apps (Tinder, Once, ...) and I've had (and still have) my best ""sex years"" ever, even better than when I was young.

But having lost my family is still something that makes me suffer at night, sometimes."
30 year old men hiding their emotions through an extremely fabricated persona on Snapchat is certainly chill af
What has our society come to for this horse shit to be encouraged?
So she's single now?
"It's been a couple of years and I still get nasty emails all the time..
I'm happy, but she's apparently still not.
You'd think being exposed as a cheater would allow you freedom, but I guess she's just an asshole that enjoyed cheating."
"I mean, I‚Äôm happy for you, but it‚Äôs shitty to mock your ex-wife now twice on social media. Makes me happy for the both of you."
Turps?
im in that process and im not sure if its easy...
"First wife was into newage ""healing"" and spent all my money and then some. Worse is she would scream at me every night until 3am. She asked for a divorce and there was nothing left to take so it was easy. I was so happy. I can't count the amount of amazing tail I had afterwards. Ex wife thought the divorce was a test, and fortunately I failed lol.


I have a new wife, first kid (7 months old) and life is a dream. I saved money on my own after divorce; we could retire on the money. New wife is sane, happy, I'm happy. No arguing. Our kid is smiles and laughs all the time; personality is strongly hereditary. Just today a lady commented on how happy our son is.  To have a perfect soul mate, who gave me this kid.. Words can't express how much that means to me.  


So thankful for divorce."
Fuck me we've really turned into boomers over here
Marriage is grand. Divorce is a hundred grand.
Nice one turps.
"That would be my answer! We have 17 married yrs under our belt but it has been a lot of work. No way in hell I would start this again with someone else. Lesson learned.

Edit: to clarify, I've learned a lot about myself through marriage, I love my wife, we  have kids together. But it's been so much work I just can't imagine starting over from square one. I'd rather develop relationships with kids, Bros, maybe an extended family member here and there. marriage is just a step too far, what with step-kid relationships, a new extended family. No thanks, i'll chill on a house boat as mentioned below."
"I can only share my entire heart and soul with one person on this earth. The rest, if it comes down to it, would get an abridged version.

"lol my wife asked me this and i replied with ""tinder would be my most used app"""
That‚Äôs seems backwards to me?
I made the same mistake when my partner asked me while we watching The Punisher. She asked me what I would do if she was killed. I told her I would become just like Frank Castle except slaying poon instead of criminals...[probably wasn‚Äôt the best thing to say](https://pics.me.me/thumb_i-shouldnt-have-said-that-i-should-not-have-said-43454571.png)
Well she‚Äôs a guy. So...

"That pussy ain't cheap...

"Sometimes when my boyfriend and I get into a heated arguement and he essentially waves the peace flag, I assume it's because he knows if we broke up that I'd be taking the cat."
"sidenote to many of the people replying: aren't you aware that you don't necessarily need to decide in such a scenario.

it's what an ex-girlfriend (so far the only woman I've lived together with) and I did when we broke up. both of us would have been devastated if we had been seperated from our doggy family member. so we basically arranged a ""shared custody"".

(which turned out to be even more beneficial in the long run. because eventually, after a few years, we have gone on to become best friends (so: entirely platonic). and we likely wouldn't have without the dog because we would have simply lost contact to each other)"
"Well, think of it this way. It's with your ex, and I'm sure she's taking care of it, since you didn't fight over it."
"No sarcasm, your ex-wife's pretty awesome."
Brilliant!
dude I have an eerily similar story. I was married for four years and then we moved to alaska and a year later we got a dissolution and she took the dogs. it's like we're living the same life at different times sPoOkY
"Oh man, this is sad. Why the divorce if it hurt so bad? I ask because I‚Äôm genuinely curious, I‚Äôm going through a horrible break up right now but both of us spend our time crying our eyes out. It doesn‚Äôt make any sense to me."
Oh man I did not think Id ever hear that bc I jusr divorced my best friend from high school together 11 yrs and same thing lol we really were more friends though and want the best for each other but same story there. How are you doing now? May I ask - was it awkward figuring out how to talk to them after like do you? Do you feel like you arent sure if youre bothering them?
I was waiting for the punch line and it never came
Assuming the ice cream machine is working...
Figuring out custody isn't a bitch unless you act up in the court house and the judge makes you go through all kinds of therapists and shit.
‚ÄúWell done! We make a great team‚Äù
"We did too. We‚Äôre not friends now and I have no desire to ever speak to him again. But we fist bumped when our divorce was final. We didn‚Äôt have kids, or a house, or even a fucking car together and we were both miserable. It was kind of just acknowledging we could stop being driving each other crazy and move on."
"/r/boneappletea, assuming you mean dissolution"
We are divorcing too but we are still good friends. I want to keep this way. We are sharing the dogs for now. We will sell the house and move with our lives but she is still my best friend.

"I think I did things backwards. With my first marriage, we were together for 4 years before trying the knot and half of that was spent living together. Our marriage lasted a year before he left me for my boss/best friend (who was also married and almost old enough to be his mother, but that's beside the point). 

My second marriage was supposed to be a drunken one night stand but he said he already knew I was it. We were both going through divorces and everything was messy and a ton of red flags. Within 3 weeks of that first hookup, I was living with him. 3 weeks later we had decided to get married ASAP. That was almost a decade ago. I love this stupid, goofy, sexy man like I have never loved another human in my entire life. We went through a really rough patch for almost 2 years. But we're both too stubborn to leave and I'm so glad we are. He is definitely my soul mate."

"My brother says this a lot. Meanwhile, he has 2-yo twin boys and a five year old that are all being raised by their mother (who is a saint) while my brother never hesitates to mountain bike or go out skiing almost every weekend. They‚Äôre still married and he likes to call her a needy weak bitch when she asks him to help out more (because he is the bread winner and she‚Äôs a stay at home mom). He likes to say ‚Äúdo your job or your fired‚Äù if the kids act up. She doesn‚Äôt even swear in front of the kids. He likes to teach the boys how to throw punches. Funny saying, but in my experience, if you‚Äôre married and joking about divorce, you might be the one in the wrong."
Yeah but is a fuckin sweet racecar bed
"No, I sleep in a big bed with OP's wife"
"aww man. It does hurt, have faith that each day you are inching away from the worst of it all."
"Man, 15 days now. Shit still hurts like motherfucker..."
This too shall pass. Hang in there.
"Can I tell you something that might sound weird and might help?

You should feel very fortunate that it hurts so much. 

Your marriage may have failed, but you ended it early enough that it still hurts. There's still enough love there to make it hurt, alhough not even to make it work. 

I'm not even divorced yet and I can't fucking wait, tbh. My wife and I have been at each other's throats for years. In my view, we already stopped being spouses ages ago, at this point the divorce will feel more like I've been stuck with a roommate I hate and the lease finally ran out.

That's why people like OP take selfies smiling about their divorce. Things get bad enough for long enough, there's nothing to be sad about."
"I am going through one. We  are separated, but it never was going to go anywhere, so in a way, I am sad that I did it, but a bit relieved that it will be mutual."
"Remind yourself that nothing stays bad forever.  You may be hurt now, but in due time you'll be happier than ever before."
You will be stronger and you will thrive. I'm 7 years out and looking back I see the whole thing as a blessing.
"My 62 year old, never married brother says ""I would never marry a woman who would have me for a husband"".  ; p"
In my experience it sucks for a bit but you‚Äôll be fine. Time does a pretty good job on this one.
I hope so too bud.  Sending a hug your way.
She sounds like she'd be a major upgrade for me.  Lemme get them digits.
Why would she be upset or even treat it like an occasion? You're literally getting divorced. Lmao.
"I feel your pain. I joined the Army just after getting married. Was putting my wife through college and after basic and AIT, I got screwed over by deployments and got Korea as my first duty station.

She immediately started cheating on me. When I asked her why, she said because I was in Korea and that all men cheat on their wives while in Korea. I didn't cheat on her. We had a joint checking account and she stole all my money and she basically black mailed me out of our truck by threatening to make the divorce hard on me if I didn't let her have it. I also paid for the lawyer and all the fees. Fuck Florida divorce laws in the 90s!

Edit: My X wife was such a hardcore bitch, that my mother-in-law apologized to me for her daughter.... and years later her best friend sent me a message telling me she has had nothing to do with her since our divorce because she was so cruel to me."
"i was in shorts and a tshirt and was shitfaced at my divorce finalization hearing.  i was amazed at myself that i could say the words ""you can't claim irreconcilable differences when there's no mention of differences or any attempt to reconcile them"".  when the judge asked if i wanted to fight the divorce claim, i simply said 'even if i did, the marriage is over, so what's the point?'"
"As Louis C.K. once said, ""no good marriage has ended in divorce."""
"I offer you...

A poor man‚Äôs gold

üèÖ

Edit: Whoever gave me this, thank you for the macho man‚Äôs gold!"
"Good on you my man. I‚Äôm going through the same shit right now; our court date is next month. I‚Äôm excited to finally be rid of my cheating, POS wife once and for all. Thank you for sharing this, means a lot to those of us going through the same crap."
You were used as a free student loan. There should be protection against this. You were basically an investor with zero payout. I've heard of this happening before but thought it was just a story.
Hey this same thing happened to me! Except she took my car. And I still haven't found my best friend yet.
"One of my clients is a catering company owned by a man and woman who used to be married.  When they got divorced, their business tripled.  Theyre both way happier, in new relationships, and way better business partners to each other."
"One of my friends is a single dad. His ex is ""the fun one"". She likes to go out and be single and party and do all the things without being encumbered by a partner or kids. 

She's great with the kids though. She can come over and see them whenever she likes. Their divorce was amicable, they both just realized that they couldn't live together as a partnership, but they hang out all the time as best friends, and the kids love their mom, since she spends a lot of time with them, just has a distinct lack of daily responsibility."
"This is me and my ex-wife. Laughed at the court house while we were filling out forms. Still good friends.
But I couldn't live with her emotional bullying, gas lighting, etc. Now we live on opposite coasts. We are still in contact since we have kids. No court ordered custody arrangements. We just work it out.
Best divorce."
I‚Äôm dying lmao
Mine was Christmas Eve. Changed my life for the better.
I imagine the used sock was very useful after.
I can actually hear the tone of voice.
"Amen, when I saw how much in alimony i would be paying I thought how on Earth am I gonna survive? Turns out when all she can do is spend 18% of my income instead of 120% it is a lot easier to live and pay bills. Only 9 more months and my student loans will be paid off, they were in deferment for 5 years when I was married üòÖ"
"Some people have the best relationships so long as they only spend a little time with each other. My wife and her stepfather are kind of like that: he's great to visit, but them sharing the same roof for more than a month winds up with things literally coming to blows."
"I‚Äôm a Divorce Dinner Baby. For years the family rumor was that I was my mom‚Äôs divorce lawyer‚Äôs kid. It was later proven false. My brother likes to mention how I look slightly Czech, like the lawyerüôÑ, but my brother is a big asshole."
"Wow, wtf... I'd definitely do the same... I'm weak willed and mistake lust for intimacy often.  A good cry with the ex makes me horny"
I'm honestly having a hard time reading her expression ü§î It's definitely not happy... but it's almost like playfully mad? It's strange...
"I mean, taking a photo like this is some petty and childish shit, especially if she didn‚Äôt want to be in the photo. Just sign the papers like an adult and get on with your life."
"Agreed. Feeling the need to drag someone through the mud a year after your divorce? It takes someone especially petty and vindictive to even care a year out. Get on with your life, mate."
OP. He definitely seems like an obnoxious person to be around.
"Yeah, never understood that line of thinking"
"It‚Äôs fairly petty and a cry for attention.  Like, congrats on being better off but why do you need to scream it from the rooftops and plaster strangers with it?

Just move on with your life."
Very very very trashy
I see this and think ‚Äúthank god she got rid of that douchebag‚Äù
LmAo xD i HaTe My WiFe Up ToP
Was that a divorce or an annulment? Did you lose anything? Alimony? Support in any way?
Was the marriage done at a drive through?
There's a reason he is divorced.
"If you are the type that celebrates a divorce, then you are probably the cause of it."
I hate these. Everyone here is cheering him on but he seems like a douchebag. For all I know she could be a bitch who cheated but he‚Äôs still a douche.
What if they hated you?
Just because you're divorced doesn't mean you can't still carpool.
"Yeah whenever I see these pics I immediately assume the same. Not sure I understand where the others are coming from as far as this type of thing ""normalizing"" divorce. He is trying to humiliate his ex wife by showcasing how happy he is to be rid of her to the entire internet. How is that not trashy?"
Asking the real questions
"this....Girlfriends..absolutely, 2nd wife...nope."
"I also have 17 years and two lovely kids.  If my wife died I would 100% marry again.  That said, the idea of doing all the work over again does seem exhausting.  I also just can't imagine that I would be able to give as much of myself to someone else.  I worry that my new wife would get a very different version of me as a husband.  Maybe with time."
I'd never marry again. My husband is lovely but I'm not willing to invest again.
"What if you are like 80 and your wife has been gone for 10 years? Actually, fuck it. I heard old folks homes are orgies basically anyways"
"That's what I don't get from people who can get married 4 times, why?"
It really sucks when I relate to this comment so hard but with someone who's no longer around.
"I told my husband the same thing and he thinks I‚Äôm crazy. I‚Äôm moderately offended his answer was a quick, yes. Lol."
My grandama died at the age of like 75 and grandapa is with another women now I was surprised but they each keeping their own homes. Been about 13 years now.
"47 here, single, never married, couldn't be happier! 

I've had a handful of serious, 3+ year relationships, and when I look at those years, I'm just happier single and even alone."
"Unconventional, but sounds kinda dope!"
"Had an uncle who did something similar.  He married a devout Catholic and divorce was out-of-the-question.

In their later years, not only did he not sleep  in the same bad as his wife, he didn't even sleep in the same house.   He bought his own.  They never divorced."
"My stepfather did this, after him and my birth mother got divorced. He was seeing a woman for years, they lived separately but were basically married. One day out of the blue he called and asked if I would feel ok with him marrying her. I remember telling him ""it's about time you make an honest woman out of her"" he got remarried at 73 and is happier than I have seen him in forever. I still think it was sweet of him to call and ask. He's a good man, always treated me as if I was his."
"""I honestly don't know honey, I haven't thought about being without you so I'm not sure what I'd do. And it's not something id like to start thinking about either"""
"The correct answer is ""What do you think honey?"". :-)"
"*It's a trap. There was no right answer*""

Reason #12,457 why I'm glad I'm not married lol"
"Depends on what you consider a right answer. Surprise option C * There is no life without you.... While tilting you head slowly to the side with your eyes wide looking directly into her soul. 

Fucked up questions get fucked up answers."
RIP
For about a week and then you realize how worthless the app is.
"""No, I don't think I could"" = I would mourn you forever, baby.

""Fuck No!"" = Being married is shit."
"I had the same confusion. My first thought was that saying no was because OP missed his wife so much that he could never love another woman again like that. A few seconds later, I realized it was because the guy's *fuck* part of his response implied that marriage was not worth it."
'Fuck no' because getting married is a lot of work and not worth it. I think that's the angle he was getting at.
She sounds hideous
"Ironically enough that's what happened with my Ex.

Dated for 2 years, married for less than 1.

During the week that would have been our anniversary they publicly anounced they were transitioning to male."
"Of course its not his wife, hes divorced"
"Holy shit, you're right, she has the ID badge that she works there. That is even funnier."
Sunglasses on top of her head. My guess is that's his ex wife on her lunch break coming to sign
"Naw it's OK, that comment was purrfect!"
"When I made the decision to leave my ex, the hardest part was also leaving the cats.  

She might have let me take the one we got together, but I didn't want to separate him from the other cat (hers) as they had become best friends. I still miss him and think of him sometimes. What a great cat."
"White flag usually means ""yeah whatever, you're right"" as winning the argument isn't worth the effort (it may also be impossible üòÇ)"
"My girl thinks if we ever broke up she‚Äôd take all of our cats. We have 3. One was hers previously, one we rescued together, and then my boy Binx. This mother fucker is 14 years old. We‚Äôve been together for 3 years. I would murder her and her whole family before she kept my dude. This bond be closer then milk and cereal. I‚Äôd be a in prison with visitation rights for my cat."
"While me and my ex stayed amicable and friendly, the fact I had to move a few thousand miles away made shared custody impossible. It really worked out for the best, as I feel it would have been hard to take care a cat alone given the nature of my job and location.

I am now happily remarried with two wonderful Chihuahuas (never thought I would ever own one) and and brand new 3 week old baby girl."
"With her wherever she is and him in ‚Äúbumfuck, Alaska ‚Äú though?"
That's going to be really hard when one spouse moves to Alaska.
"Absolutely, she loved that cat and could take better care of her then I could in Alaska as a bachelor working all the time. And the Jeep I got to keep was a life saver in Alaska."
"They say you leave Alaska with one of the three D's. Divorce, Dog or Dependent."
"Because love changes, and sometimes it just hurts to lose something. Pain doesn't mean you can resurrect a dead thing."
"Because of a bunch of things.  We'd been together for years and being alone is scary.  Also because while we did and do love each other I'm not sure it was ever romantic love.  The other part was mental health, we both had and still have mental health problems.  It happened that ours served to make each other's issues worse.  I wish her the best but it was better for both of us that we split up but boy it's hard in the moment"
"I'm doing really good.  I think she's doing well but honestly it's hard to know.  Once we really stopped talking after the divorce we kinda became like work friends.  We're superficially close but it's too painful to be as close as we could be.  Also it was preventing either of us from moving on.  

You'll get through it."
This is more upsetting than my parents divorce.
That‚Äôs why you always go to Wendy‚Äôs
Yeah that‚Äôs exactly what happened. My dad was a bit of a wild card and they both wanted full custody. Ended up being split 50/50 with them having to do pick ups and drop offs at a local police station. It was rough
"""Let's get married"""
"""Why did we even file a divorce?""
""Because you cheated on me, multiple times.""
""Oh."""
*made a great team
Why did u guys get married in the first place if you don't mind me asking.
Okay but it could also be r/technicallythetruth
Monorail monorail monorail!!!
It‚Äôs the ones who don‚Äôt leave each other and work through the shit  that stay married.

Your brother is taking his family for granted and when he loses it he's going to crash hard
Your brother sounds like a dick and a shitty father.
Is he going mountain biking and skiing with the same work friend every weekend by any chance?
"If he is doing his own thing on weekends without his family and is calling her names, it sounds like your brother believes the other saying; ""It's cheaper to keep her."""
No offense but your broth sounds like a huge asshole
Sooner or later your brother will realize that he's spoiled beyond belief.  Unfortunately for him it will be about 6-7 months after she's discoved that fact.
"My uncle was this way.  He was an alcoholic, constantly undermining my aunt, letting his son ""be a boy"".  My uncle has recovered and is much better, but their son, now 22, is an abusive asshole, druggie that steals from anyone and everyone.  He hit his mother, beat up countless girlfriends, has numerous arrest warrants, but they keep letting him out... Its crazy, because there is a collective sigh of relief when he's locked away.  I know his father regrets it, but the damage has been done.  They also have a daughter who is not a raging asshole, so he could have turned out better."
I never get why guys like this get married and have kids in the first place.
"He seems like a grade A douche who will eventually regret his behavior, but it'll be too late. Mark my words."
He sounds like a deadbeat
"Kick your brother's ass, you are one of the only people allowed to, and it might help him out in the long run."
"That sounds like my brother-in-law and how he treats my sister. Works 40+hrs/week and on the weekend, goes and does his own thing. My sister is a stay at home mom and he treats her like her job isn't even difficult (2.5yr old and 5yr old). Then when she's actually able to get away for a weekend once every few months and he's supposed to spend some quality time with them, he dumps the kids off at his parent's house instead. And the amount he belittles her, in front of the kids, is way too much. And then they wonder why their 5yr old is such a little asshole to her (I love that little goober more than life itself. Still an asshole). Well if dad can treat mom that way, why wouldn't he? Monkey-see Monkey-do. I just wish my sister thought higher of herself. I wish she understood how much better she deserves (has some unresolved issues from our childhood which has done it's own damage to her self-esteem). Not only that SHE deserves better, but those kids deserve someone who wants to spend time with them. If she ever comes to her senses, I think he'll be perfectly fine having no ball and chain aka a family. Besides child support of course."
Your brother is a piece of shit.  You should let him know frequently.
Your brother is a piece of shit.
Talk to him. He is taking everything for granted. And he will lose it all
"If that's how he treats her when you're around, I guarantee he abuses her even worse when you're not."
"I'm a stay at home mom, that's bullshit."
Your brother sounds like a monumental prick of the highest order.
"your brother is a fucking dickhead

edit: no offense"
Your brother sounds like a fucking loser.
I‚Äôm getting a CB radio next week so I can talk to other race car beds
Ex wife
1-877-KARS4KIDS
"Man, you sure can pick em."
"She lies to herself about her situation and her own responsibility and doesn‚Äôt like it pointed out to her.

To this day she maintains ‚Äòwe both made mistakes.‚Äô And if you let her, she‚Äôll start telling you how I was working two jobs and away and how I ‚Äògrew cold‚Äô and so forth.

The truth is I worked two jobs because she didn‚Äôt work and was supposed to be a stay at home mom, which I was totally cool with. Except that she didn‚Äôt really do anything when she was home. And why would you bring up that I was working a lot? It was necessary for the home she wanted.

I ‚Äògrew cold‚Äô because she kept cheating and my dumb ass would get angry, then forgive her, rinse and repeat. I didn‚Äôt get really pissy until it was finally over, then hey, why gloss over anything any longer? You lose the benefit of forgiveness when you toss the relationship aside.

I maintain a friendship with her for the kid‚Äôs sake, but she still tries to manipulate and do as little as possible, and pay for next to nothing."
"Divorce aside, generally you dress more formally if appearing in front of a judge.  When I had jury duty the judge kicked somebody out of his courtroom for wearing shorts."
"To be fair, she was losing her home, her financial support, and her housemaid all in the same day."
">I joined the Army just after getting married.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

>She immediately started cheating on me.

&#x200B;

is this a right of passage in the US military or some shit? 

""fill out this form, pick up your m16 here, now get married and have the wife start fucking other men, now!"""
Did four in the Marines. Saw that shit happen to a lot of guys. The thing that galls me is that the military always seems to side with spouses without even looking into what‚Äôs occurred.
"Read the first two sentences. Knew immediately where it was going. If that's not sad, I don't know what is."
"Florida divorce laws haven't changed much. Mine took years because she wouldn't show up , repetitively and then would only come when the judge would tell her attorney ""If she doesn't show up next time, I'm giving him everything"". She failed the drug test, no job (parents paid for attorney) and all that jazz. Day before trial my attorney calls me and says ""They offered every holiday break with no child support but you pay airfare and healthcare, you need to take this deal, the father never wins.""  
Thanks dick! Glad you spent years charging me and selling the ""We're sure to get custody."" dream."
Gotta watch out for Jody...
‚ÄúDivorce gets stronger every year. It‚Äôs like an oak tree‚Äù
"""Now watch me jerk off."""
"I love that bit, not just because it's funny. He's right, saying ""I'm so sorry you got divorced"" is not what divorced people want to hear (90% of the time anyway)."
">Edit: Whoever gave me this, thank you for the macho man‚Äôs gold!

OOOOOOOOH YEAH!"
"This happened to my aunt too. She worked two jobs and took care of their kids while he went to undergrad and then law school. Their agreement was once he was a lawyer, she could go to school. Once he was a lawyer, he left her for his secretary. She wound up teaching herself programming and still came out doing very well financially even without a degree, but she definitely developed some harsh beliefs about men that affected both of her children and she was pretty bitter for the rest of her life, which was sad. She was a very smart and driven person."
Yeah and got treated like shit while doing so. I was so pissed off at her for how she‚Äôd been treating me all throughout the engagement and after we‚Äôd gotten married that I asked her for a divorce on our honeymoon lol. She did take advantage of me and got a pretty decent payday from me on the day we got divorced too. I was so mentally exhausted from the entire marriage that I had just given up.
"She should have to pay back every dollar he spent on her education, simple as that. It upsets me that a lot of men just throw their hands up and walk away without a fight. I‚Äôd of made that woman pay me for years. She knew exactly what she was doing."
"reminds me of the couple who owned a pizza restaurant, they divorced and she ended up with the restaurant . The guy started up his own pizza restaurant right next to hers just to spite her, in the end the publicity brought in a lot of customers for both. This all happened long ago, they are still in business competing against each other."
I hope she pays a ton of child support.
She sounds like a piece of shit tbh.
"That‚Äôs one of the oldest jokes around. 

A woman is like a tornado. She‚Äôs wet and wild at first but when she‚Äôs done she takes your house and car."
"I received my divorce certificate in the mail on Christmas Eve, it was the best Christmas present ever"
You're the hero Reddit deserves.
It's the top comment from the first time this was posted a year ago.
I‚Äôm in the same boat. Now that she‚Äôs only getting 1/3 of my income I‚Äôm finally able to make headway against my debt and build savings. She keeps complaining that she doesn‚Äôt have enough money but it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs my fault she refuses to get a real job.
"My parents moved into separate apartments 3 years ago, still married just not living together. They have an awesome relationship now, way better then my entire childhood."
She looks like she‚Äôs making a pretend mad face.
is she his ex? isn't she (on the pic) a worker where he got the divorce?
It's to a point where I'm sure she hates me but its hurts so bad to let her go because she was my first
"Nope, cabin in the wood as far as away as fucking possible from every other motherfucker. I trip a month in to town for necessities. That's what I would do after being widowed or divorced."
What lesson?
And the STD rates are crazy. They just don't care anymore. But hey what ever keeps them happy.
The rates of STDs are through the roof apparently.
I thought it was more of a Lemon Party?
Heard that too. They've gotta scratch that wrinkle.
"There's a famous case study among medical and nursing schools about the retirement community ""The Villages"" in Florida and high STD rates.  Older folks who had been married a long time and never learned about safe sex."
"Afraid of being alone, co-dependence, broke need someone to take care of them, or any other number of possibilities."
"My grandfather did the same thing. He was so devoted to my nanna but after she suddenly died he connected with a woman who had recently also lost her husband. They kept separate households and had a really happy 5 years until she suddenly declined with Alzheimers last year. It makes sense to keep seeking love, even after your ""big one"" is gone."
"Good on you for being comfortable with that.  Lots of people would have forced themselves into a marriage because that's what is ""expected"" only to make everyone miserable."
"42 here, single, never married, no kids.  Interested in changing precisely none of that!

I've been in relationships; I just find that a.) I'm more comfortable with myself and in charge of my own schedule, and b.) I like myself more when I'm not in a relationship.  I kind of turn mildly paranoid in one (due to self-esteem issues and whatnot)."
"""Seperation"" in relationships is underrated. Tv and movies shit on couples that sleep in different beds, but sometimes I feel like sleeping without a war for the blanket or several random kicks in the night. 

I grew up almost alone. It's a part of me. I feel like an ass when I tell my bf to leave me alone for like a week and I'm basically just in another room, but that's what I'm used to and in the end is something that I need."
"My husband's grandparents.  Similar.  Catholic.  Hated each other.  So he leaves her and the kid.  (Not that I blame him as she was a complete psycho.. but abandoning the son to the complete psycho was not cool.)

He'd taken up with another woman.  They spent 50+ years together when Grandmother dies.  He is diagnosed with Alzheimers about the same time.   GF dumps him.  Ends up with son... good thing Psycho raised the son Catholic because only good old fashioned Catholic guilt got him to take the old man who abandoned him in.  


edit.. didn't make it clear.. They never divorced because.. Catholic... but they never lived together again either."

Basically if the machine is ""broken"" chances are it's not broken, employees just don't want to clean it.   30 minutes before closing, I'm good with that.   Middle of the afternoon?  Employees are lazy assholes but I aint rocking no boat with people who prep and serve me my food."

Sounds like my (soon to be) ex-wife.  I felt like a single parent of 2 kids (and 1 adult).
lol your divorcing and she is still bitching about the clothes you wearing to this ocassion what a clown
"Ex-wife does the same, I have simply refuse to acknowledge her existence.

Usually cheaters and liars do the ""we both made mistakes"" song and dance."
I really will never understand how some people can cheat on a SO like that. It is like their brains are wired differently.
That ‚Äúwe both made mistakes‚Äù line is evidently universal. Wow.
"Same thing with my ex-fiancee. She'd have an emotional meltdown and get pissed off at me for going to work and not staying with her, but she wasn't working and I was supporting us both on a 25k/year salary as a Store Manager for Blockbuster. It's like ""somebody has to work to pay the bills, sorry if that conflicts with your bipolar bullshit."". Of course she found another man to cry to (also unemployed so tons of free time) because I was working all the time. I think that pissed me off the most, not the fact that she was cheating, but that she was cheating on me while I was working to support her ass then somehow she actually justified it because I ""wasn't there for her"". Cooking, cleaning, yeah right...she'd sleep til noon and lay on bed all day reading trashy romance novels.

Thank Christ we broke up before the actual wedding."

"Just the home and maid. She gets child support -we have the kids 50/50, so don‚Äôt ask me why- and she also has been living with a dude since 2 years before there divorce went through.

Where I live they don‚Äôt give a fuck about these things though."
"Their relationships aren't very strong to begin with, and a married soldier gets paid more and gets to move out of the barracks. Plus the military will pay for the move, so if you're dating your highschool sweetheart and you're about to get moved across the country the only way for them to go with you is to get married. Plus when you get home for the first time you're riding months of horny that makes you really dumb."
That's so backwards it isn't even funny.
"There are actually people who remarry each other. It‚Äôs...odd. Back when I did social work I worked with a lady who was remarrying her husband for the 3rd time. They had already divorced each other twice. But apparently their relationship would *totally* work this time. 

I haven‚Äôt heard from her in years. I wonder how many more times they‚Äôve divorced and remarried by now."
Yeah that's an unbelievably strong woman. But that is the kind of shit that breaks even the strongest people.
"This happened to a friend of mine. He went to school first, she was supposed to go second. When he was done, he left her for her best friend. Her lawyer said they could probably convince the judge to make him help pay for her schooling as part of the divorce decree, as this happens a lot and that's the standard way of dealing with it. She didn't want a fucking thing from him though."
"How would you 'make' her pay you though? It's horrible what she did but I don't think it's illegal so it'd be hard to get a ruling in a court that she has to pay. I'd love to be mistaken on that though, so if you have evidence to the contrary please share it."
"> I‚Äôd of made that woman pay me for years.

Secondly, how?"
My mom's got some friends who moved here from Mexico and opened a Mexican restaurant. One day the wife said she wanted a divorce and they were fighting over the restaurant till she said that she was getting the divorce because she's a lesbian and in love with a woman. Apparently he was very conservative and this was very humiliating for him so he signed everything over and moved back to Mexico.
Ya for real. She wants the good parts of being a mom with none of the bad. She‚Äôs more of a family friend. Or a aunt than a mother. If she was my mom I‚Äôd hate her. My dad tried to be like that. I hate him.
I hear the tone in that as well.
The fucking entitlement pisses me off so much. You guys are divorced and she wants you to take care of her financial needs without her having to work? Fucking disgusting.
She's kind of cute in that new way I find women attractive in my 30s.

"I moved to Germany from uk brought my dog with me but saw she was sad as we spent the prior 6 months staying with my parents and she got used to all my neices and nephews and all the people coming and going. 

So I brought her back to stay at my parents.

I really miss her actually :-( I move to Switzerland in a few weeks and when I get an apartment im going to bring her over. One of the reasons I found a better paid job is so I can afford full time dog day care when I'm at work so she won't get bored. A dog walker wasn't enough. But if I feel she is sad again I will just have to accept she stays with my parents permanently."

"This was exactly me and my ex. When we decided to get a divorce we were hugging and crying. It's hard to let go of something sometimes even when you know it's dead/unhealthy/etc. If you've learned on each other for emotional support, that doesn't necessarily go away when that decision is made."
"Happened to me too. We were no longer compatible, we wanted totally different things, we both knew it had to end, but it just hurt *so much*. We were still best friends. And neither of us had a friend closer than the other to comfort them, so we held each other and cried for weeks. Every time we saw each other it was just total waterworks. In the end it only stopped when I moved country."

If they say it's broken theres just as good chance it probably is, because all of the small moving parts get gunked up with old ice cream insanely fast.  

With that said if you go to any place that has shakes or soft serve and their machine is always broken you shouldn't be ordering from their ever again. It's a huge red flag that they aren't keeping shit clean.

"Dude you and I both. I feel like I have 3 kids, 5, 2, and 22. It's ridiculous. I get the 5 year old isn't hers, and isn't her responsibility, but jesus christ she has no job and does 0 house work while I work 12 hour days to pay the bills. Every other day her excuse is ""I had to babysit, their kids are destructive"" and the other days ""my depression is too bad to do anything, my grandpa died"". I get she was close to her grandpa but the excuse gets old a year later for crippling depression. She refuses counseling, and is already medicated for anxiety and depression. The part that gets me the most is even when we are low on money she will throw a fit like a toddler to make me take her out to go do something, while the house is a wreck and it is my only day off through the week. I sleep MAYBE 4 hours a night and she sleeps around 10 to 12 hours a day, and is somehow always tired. She's best friends WITH MY EX FIANCE/the mother of my 5 year old, and if I won't take her out on my day off, she will get her to take her out, leaving me with both kids and trying my best to clean the mess from the days I was working. God I'm so fucking stressed and never get to vent, sorry."

"Paying child support is pretty normal in that circumstance, at least in Canada. Whichever parents earns more still has to pay child support, even with 50/50 custody because the courts want kids to have roughly the same standard of living in both homes, for the sake of consistency and to make the transition between the homes less jarring/stressful for the kids.

Not saying I agree with it at all, but that‚Äôs the court‚Äôs logic for you. Family law is  weird."
The Onion just [did this article yesterday](https://politics.theonion.com/trump-honors-brave-heroes-who-slept-with-wives-of-deplo-1836308926) .
"My grandpa divorced/remarried my grandma I want to say it was 4 times because he wanted to sleep with other women but thought cheating was wrong.  I think somewhere in the middle he married one of the other chicks but then divorced her to sleep with/remarry my grandma.  

He was also an alcoholic child abuser, so not exactly right in the head."
You‚Äôre not wrong. At some point you just need to take your losses and move on.
Swap the genders and that‚Äôs exactly what alimony is - money paid because one partner gave up things to make the relationship work.
"There's a time and a place for alimony. If one spouse is making $150k/year and the other is making $30k, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense for her to keep working all of those hours and go through all of that stress just boost their combined income by 20%.

Especially when part of that $30k would go towards daycares and babysitters and stuff like that. It makes so much more sense for her to stay at home, spend a lot more quality time with kids instead of dumping them at daycare and paying someone else to do it, take care of the home, and be free of the stress of working life. It's better for her, better for the kids, and should be better for him when his wife has a happier, less stressful life.

But suppose they turn 50, the kids are grown and out of the house, and he decides he's sick of her and with his money he can find some 30 year old to go out with, so he divorces her. Should she leave with nothing? No income, no savings, no retirement, no career, no job prospects due to no work history... should she be screwed just because he left her?

Of course not. It was a mutual decision for her to be a stay at home mom, and that means he's taking financial responsibility for her in order to create a situation that should benefit the whole family.

If there are no alimony laws, then women wouldn't dare to be stay at home parents. Even though it would be the best arrangement for their family and make all of their lives better, they'd think ""I can't afford to risk doing this because what if he leaves me years down the line, I need to have my own career and own retirement plan just in case"". That would be stupid, and that's why alimony exists. Don't want to risk having to pay it? They don't get into a marriage where you're the sole breadwinner and your spouse stays at home."

"> well, no shit don't donate money to the kkk

Right?

If you give money to the KKK, what percentage goes to *actually* oppressing minorities vs just getting wasted on high threadcount luxury sheets, fancy scented (and probably *colored*) tiki torch oil, and homeopathic blindness treatments for Grand Dragon Dave Chappelle?

If we look at the world today vs what existed when the KKK was created in the late 19th century, I'd say it's a pretty safe judgement that they are a terribly ineffective organization.  They definitely don't deserve your hard earned dollars.

"Bro. Don't even sweat it. Things are replaceable. Your mental well being is important.

I met  a girl at age 21. We were married and divorced by 25. Ppl change. She would spend money like a crazy person. Like there was a point where I deployed and she moved in with her parents and the only bills we had were car insurance and cellphone. She would spend my entire pay check within several days of pay day... Then draw an extra 1,000 out of savings once a month and blow through that as well....

Then when I came home things got better for a bit... Then we had move and it started over again, but at this point shed just get drunk/high leave the house a wreck, and abuse the animals ( she literally drove my cat out into the county and left it on the side of the road cuz it scratched her while she was giving it a bath).

There's more but I'm blathering on at this point. The point is, I spent my last dime getting out of that relationship and it was 10000% worth it for my financial health and mental well being.

Nearly 6 years later, I'm debt free. Have a solid chunk of money saved up. Have a gf who is an ACTUAL partner. Pays her half of everything. Cleans her fair share.

Life gets better. It can be scary. No one WANTS a divorce, but some times it is for the best. Never worry about your money or the things you'll lose in the divorce process. You'll make more money (and actually get to keep it) and get new things."
"It's only going to get worse, man.  She will probably cheat on you too.  Every time I knew a guy in this situation they got cheated on.

Get it over with now before you have to pay alimony to an entitled cunt for the rest of your life."

"> other places aren't showered with prescription drug commercials

It seems so insane to have commercials for something that you're not allowed to buy.  A professional is supposed to know what medicine you need and prescribe that to you.  If it's possible for someone to see a commercial for something, tell their doctor ""oh hey, how about some of that stuff I saw on TV"", and then the doctor actually fucking gives it to them, then something is profoundly fucked up with the system.

Like, if it's an over-the-counter that anyone can purchase, then commercials make sense.  But why the fuck is a commercial telling me to tell my *doctor* what medicines I need?"

"Oh what the hell, I‚Äôll give it a try. I‚Äôm feline frisky."
"It might be better on the kids. Have a better role model to look up to and actual responsibility taught to them. I've seen way too many parents just give into their kids because it's ""easier"" but later in life they generally thank the responsible parent more. It might not be easy now, but think about the future for your kids. It might give you a better perspective on things. Just plan the divorce out ahead of time (without her even knowing) with a lawyer and get ready for a fight, but you need to think about yourself plus the well being of your kids. I know more people who have parents that stay together who fight all the time that have it rougher than those who split up. I got lucky that my parents are still together and don't fight very often."
"Kids can sense when stuff isn't right and want their parents to be happy. I grew up in a family seeing my mother physically and verbally abused. My mom thought she was toughing it out for me and my sister. But she was miserable. Her hair went completely grey at a young age and I thought she was going to kill her self... No joke.

At 12 or 13 I told her that we wanted her to be happy and that I thought she should file for divorce. And she did just that and everyone was much happier in the long run.

Some times things don't work out between parents. You can still be an excellent dad without being a husband to their mother. It may hurt at first, but it may be worth it in the long run if you are feeling this way.

I wish you happiness in what ever choice you make. I just want you to know divorce might suck, but it sometimes is for the better. It won't make you a failure. It won't make you a bad dad. You will be able to recover from it if that's the route you choose."
"Whether they understand it now or not, doing the right thing will be a positive example in the long run. You don't want them to grow up thinking this is what love is supposed to be like."

"I'm hoping we get 1 more after that but that would be a bonus if anything. Only reason I say is becasue light side need a jetpack hero imo and either Sabine or Bo Katan are the only ones I can think of. Mother Talzin would make a kick ass and unique option for the darkside if they get one more from he prequels as well.

But yeah if they cane out with Jyn, Krennick and Scarif next I'd be more than satisfied."

But after that my friends were telling my to stop whispering, I had gotten so use to talking quietly from always being told to stop screaming now that I could hear I was whispering.

"Just took my kid to a specialist because he is loud and says he doesn‚Äôt know he‚Äôs being loud, and sometimes he doesn‚Äôt seem to hear us. Turns out he‚Äôs just loud and has a listening problem."
Or this kid is just a comical genius
Yeah... I gotta give credit where it's due. That was a pretty snappy response.
I did not even think about the kid being hearing impaired and now I feel awful.
"My son‚Äôs preschool teacher took me to the side once and told me that my son avoids anything with loud noises. Like, he would hangout on the outside of group time, refused to participate in music time, and other times he would just cover his ears whenever a kid got too loud. I took him in to see his doctor and he referred me to a nose, throat, ear specialist. We found out that he had fluid in his ears and regular noises to us were amplified by a thousand to him. Thankfully the problem corrected itself. If it wasn‚Äôt for his preschool teacher telling me I would‚Äôve never known. She was helpful with controlling the classroom for a bit and modified some of the activities for him too. She was the best."
Kids are fucking woke
"Seriously, this is the *polar opposite* of this subreddit.

This belongs here: r/KidsAreFuckingSmart"
I was that mostly deaf kid that was always yelling and almost got kicked out because I wouldn't follow to rules and ignored instructions. I vividly remember some of those days too. Thanks for being a good preschool teacher and hopefully looking for the signs!
"I had really bad ear infections as a child, to the point where I kinda stopped telling my mom when my ear was messed up because it just felt normal. I ended up being a super loud person because i couldn't fuckin hear anything when i was sick, which was a decent chunk of the time."
This was actually one of the ways they realized that I was partially deaf. I still have trouble controlling my volume and I never know if I'm yelling or not
I mean I did get louder after my right eardrum ruptured and I lost all hearing in it. Granted though I was 16 so I wasn't a child.
"How is this profound?

And why are you associating it with something clearly nothing related to it?

Smell of new Reddit bot #botPopular to me

Either that or your associations and ability to make distinctions are so out of tune that Justin Bieber is an angel to listen to.

Edit: I just realised, Reddit is for those current not those ahead of the curve and big picture *sad face*"
I have a friend who's so soft spoken it sounds like he's almost whispering when he talks normally. I can't even imagine the guy yelling. That would probably be quite terrifying
concentrate on your diaphragm when you speak. There's a difference between yelling and turning the volume up. From a fellow mumblr
"Same lmao, if I try to talk I‚Äôm almost always talked over. When I have the opportunity, I have nothing to talk about and my mom gets pissed off lol"
"When I respond I can sound rude and upset.

I promise I'm not. I don't meant so sound aggressive or rude :("
"I had a friend who‚Äôs default talking voice sounded incredibly sarcastic, plus he was a naturally sarcastic dude, so it was always a guessing game if we was being serious."
Same. I have two volumes: ‚Äúcan you speak up?‚Äù and *everyone in the office glares at me and puts on their noise canceling headphones.* They both sound the same to me and I can‚Äôt choose which comes out.
Calm down friend.
Omg this happens to me so much
Damn I feel you my nickname in my 10th grade yearbook class was Mumbles
Oh my god it‚Äôs the same thing for me and it sucks.

I hate that. ‚ÄúYou sound angry‚Äù no I just said something you don‚Äôt like. ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you saying anything‚Äù because you usually call me an asshole when I do.
"I just get told to talk softer especially in public places (like restaurant) cause my voice carries like a motherfucker even when I'm trying to speak softly, sucks at times."
"Yeah dammit I wanna laugh at kids, not with them."
90% of this sub is what you just described
"Pretty much all of the ‚Äúmy kid said something clever‚Äù tweets are just parents projecting and putting words in their kid‚Äôs mouth. Once you‚Äôre surrounded by parents you realize they exaggerate constantly about their children.

Child: ‚ÄúDoo doo pee pee mermaid.‚Äù"

Seems to me to be more like a parent starving for attention.
"When my brother was little, my parents noticed he would always get really close to the TV. Took him for a hearing test, turned out it was his eyesight that was shit lol."
"My little brother was the opposite. As a premie, his ears didn‚Äôt fully develop. But we didn‚Äôt know until it became apparent he still wasn‚Äôt speaking English despite being well past speaking age. Had his own language going on. 

Turned out he just heard everything muffled, so repeated as he heard things. Once he had surgery and started speech therapy, it also became apparent that his cute babble actually largely consisted of calling people assholes and asking where his god damn backpack is every morning before school, and telling us he was gonna kill us in our sleep ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø"
"Same issue, everyone still thinks I'm an asshole. Am 27."
In their defense most people in elementary school are assholes.
"Same: my brother and I are partly deaf in opposite ears, people thojght we were just loud assholes but we legit couldn't hear eachother."
"Same, people used to complain that i kept turning my head to the side when they were speaking to me (pointing my good ear at them)

Nobody believed I couldn't hear properly, doctors said I was attention seeking, wasn't till I was finishing high school did they figure out ""oh he's actually deaf"""
I'm deaf in one ear and it still happens.
"My nickname growing up was microphone, and I always said huh when someone would ask me something, even when I‚Äôd know what they said... hmm"
I'm half deaf(can only hear with my right ear). Everyone who's ever stood on my left side thinks I'm still an asshole.
"My mother had me tested repeatedly as a child, but it turns out I‚Äôm just loud. It works out as an educator though. üòÇ

One of my friends is deaf and has cochlear implants, but you still have to be pretty loud to get her attention. I think people think I‚Äôm the asshole when I‚Äôm with her, because I have to literally yell her name to get her attention."
Maybe you are just a deaf asshole?
I'm an asshole and now that I have tinnitus I can use that as an excuse instead of going out of my way to ignore what people are saying.
I had to have tubes in my ears twice
[deleted]
"That's really interesting. Do you remember what the problem was? My doc told me I produce an ""abnormal"" amount of earwax, especially when my allergies are bad, so my hearing gets worse when there's lots of buildup but I can usually clean it out myself in the shower with one of those water pump things."
"I did that with our kids. The first one had a phase as a toddler where she would routinely ask us to repeat ourselves, so I took her to the ent. Turns out her hearing was fine, some kids just do that. Second kid comes around, same thing again, take her to the ent and mention the first one's ""tick"". Nope, this one had blocked ears and genuinly couldn't hear properly."
"The specialist says he's ""some kind of asshole"" who ""doesn't listen because he's a little shit"" and that we should ""get out"" before he ""calls"" the police."
How does one lose hearing from a ruptured eardrum?
Relax
"Sooo, ask him to act angry for you, curiosity killed the cat, but it also went to mars"
Is your friend Roose Bolton?
Yeah that's the issue. It takes so much energy to do that so when I'm tired it's just the worst.
I always speak from the diaphragm and constantly get told I talk too loud. Tried to figure out a quieter way to talk but I can't get enough air out my face hole to make noise unless I'm using my diaphragm so whatever I guess.
This thread is very cathartic to me.
"This was me in high school. The amount of people I hated and called out on their shit, who thought we were friends and that I was just kidding, was super frustrating."
Practice your speaking volume and try to use your diaphragm when you speak. It takes practice but you can get it
"''Just because you're upset doesn't mean I'm angry''.

I mean it doesn't calm the situation, lol, but it's funny and at least you aren't in a corner."
"Quick, someone link some moron kid for eye bleach, STAT!"
"No it isn't. Go look at the frontpage right now. *Maybe* Superhero, Pokemon and IDK cards is a little clever, but the vast majority is kids being actually stupid."
Not really?
This is just straight up wrong.
"Nah, kids are better at dad jokes than dads are."
To see if I still bleEeEed
"I thought it was a lyric from kids see ghosts considering the title is almost ""I feel freeeeeeeee"""
So this is a sub of low lifes who take their anger at kids ?
"If you worked around kids, you'd know that this is so perfectly fitting for what children say all the time that it looks impossible to have made up.  Not to mention that children are better at dad jokes than dads are.  

""No one loves you""

""Who's No One?  Is he cute?""

Children bickering is golden, it's just that people only ever seem to notice kids being idiots or throwing tantrums.  You've got to look past their underdeveloped neurology to appreciate children."

"They understand the concept of being locked up, but an abstract concept like freedom from social constraints seems less likely."
"Except free in this context is philosophical in nature.   It's not, "" I was in time out, and now I am free."""
"Before I found out I was nearsighted, I always said that our fancy giant ultra HD TV was not HD and very blurry."
"I had a hearing impaired roommate. I‚Äôd come home from work and turn in the TV and HOLY SHIT IT WAS FUCKING LOUD.  

Like I get it but even holding the volume down button as I turned on the tv I couldn‚Äôt get it down fast enough to not have my ears bleed. I can‚Äôt imagine having hearing that bad. I felt too bad to say anything to him about it and just lived with it for a couple years. 

When we watched it together he just wore his hearing aid."
"I was the same. One time they finally told me to back up and I apparently said that I couldn‚Äôt tell which person was the boy and which was the girl. When they took me to get checked, my prescription was already at -5.00. I was 4 years old. Even more blind now."

That was a wild ride
A hearing test ? Am I reading this correctly
lol
Once I was backing up a car during the night to get to a parking spot way back in our row house's yard and I turned down the radio so I could see better.
Seems like a vision test makes more sense if the kid keeps getting too close to the TV.
"My parents always said that watching the tv too close would ruin my eyesight, when in reality it was already ruined and I watched close so I could see it"
The opposite happened with me. I was sitting too close to the tv and my parents got my eyes checked. Lol. I ended up needing tubes put in my ears.

Have you tried switching places? Does that just make it too hard for you to hear everyone else?
"""I am very cool"""
Huh what's yours like? I have the same problem but I have one of those cheap kits and it usually plugs my ears up when the watered down wax settles in my ears so I try to only use it as a last resort when I get completely plugged up. same thing happens with Q-tips. they take some wax out but they also push some of it in further so in a way I'm worse off than before. Once in high school spent like a month with one ear or the other blocked. At aome point during the whole thing both got blocked and I was able to hear bodily functions I never noticed before like blood flowing. Ever since then I can still hear/feel it.
"If you're comfortable sticking stuff in your ear, bobby pins work really well for scraping out wax. Just work your way around the outer portion if the ear canal slowly taking more each time, don't just jam the thing in there."
Pretty much.
"Well idk if I exactly ruptured it, I just had alot of pressure inside my ear and suddenly it released and a bunch of blood gushed out and after that happened my hearing went away and it never came back."
"I have a deep voice but also soft spoken, when I need to yell though it booms."
The other day he said a swear word(!!) when we were playing a game together and even just that took me by surprise. He's 26 but he never even swears so yeah.. yelling would be a sight to behold.
Just tell him you lost his [favorite paper clip collection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVLCXtG5HZ8)
it would be like this https://youtu.be/PEfZG9OSytA
Kill his cat and he'll probably yell a little bit.
It's a habit. Build it now so you can use it later.
Yea like my first 2 hours of the day in the office when I am still waking up I constantly struggle between whispering a hello/good morning or feeling like I say it too loud and animated when I try to compensate

"As a goody two-shoes nerd I'd get mad at the teachers for writing on the white board with light colors.  I pretty much couldn't make out anything except black or navy blue.

I almost found out too late. I got a brand new 72 inch beast of a TV and apparently had it so loud that the landlord a block over could hear it. Almost got kicked out on the spot until my landlord agreed that if I had a hearing test and could prove I wasn't lying about the TV sounding normal to me. Turns out I'm entirely deaf in my left ear and partially in my right. I just use a nice pair of studio headphones now.
I have definitely taken my glasses off to try and hear better.... The worst was when I turned up my laptop volume to hear the person next to me better...
"Yes, they thought he couldn't hear, it turned out he couldn't see. Both are reasons one might sit close to the TV."
"Well, probably not a *proper* hearing test, for one he had just turned 3, and also this was early 80s Poland. I should've written that they took him to an otolaryngologist to check on his ears, but that doesn't exactly roll off the tongue.

I don't know why their gut feeling was bad hearing instead of bad eyesight, but clearly my brother didn't help clear up the confusion."
"This is a thing, (but can't remember what the phenomenon is called...)"
"Being it up to his pediatrician. They‚Äôll be able to tell you if it‚Äôs time to be concerned yet. 

My sister  has spent the better part of a decade teaching at various schools for the deaf and being an ASL interpreter, and now has a master‚Äôs in Special Education. She was concerned my cousin was deaf or hard of hearing due to her being about 2, still not verbal, and seemingly not responding to auditory stimuli. Turns out my cousin was just a shy, late bloomer. 

It wasn‚Äôt until my brother was about 4, 4.5 that doctors / teachers really got concerned. Wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfixed‚Äù until kindergarten, and he had to do a jr first grade in order to catch up with a speech pathologist.

Edit - with the digital age id probably recommend having video on your phone of your son attempting to communicate, too, as kids can get put off by the dr‚Äôs office. 

But I‚Äôd bet a lot his doctor won‚Äôt be concerned at this stage."
I babysat a little boy just like that. Chronic ear infections. I think he finally got tubes in and then learned to speak proper English pretty soon after.
"Good bot, added another shortcut to my keyboard to do the shrug specifically on Reddit."
"My dad is military and my older brother let him watch Child‚Äôs Play.

Good correction.
What did they say?
"My suggestion is to try to get a good workout in. I have the same issue, including plugging up my hearing, and I notice if I can get myself hot/sweaty enough the wax will literally melt away. A little gross/messy but I've stopped having the build up get so insane since getting more active."
"That‚Äôs exactly what you hear when you put a seashell in your ear, your blood flow"
"I used to have a shit ton of earwax buildup until I met my girlfriend. Earwax is apparently a big issue in East Asia so they have these ear scoops that are designed to dig out earwax. You can buy them for under a dollar on eBay. It's easier if someone digs for you but you can also do it your self.

There also these eardrops you can buy at pharmacies that dissolve the wax and make it loose. You then rinse it out with water. My ears were pretty much squeaky clean after I used that the last time."
"Honestly I just keep one of those water squeegie things in the shower and clean every 2-3 days. It works well enough when I stay on top of it, but every year or so I go to the doctor and get it professionally cleaned out."
"Same. I call it my ""big boy voice""... I'm 38"
"I worked with a guy who never swore once. I was complaining about one of the managers and he said ""yeah I really don't like her very much"", so I told him to tell us how he really felt. Dude says ""Oh, well she's a complete cunt"". Completely blew me away that he even knew swear words in the first place."
"No really, I can and do speak loud enough unless I'm tired or too relaxed. My friend gets annoyed at me on voicechat because if I talk to hime earlier in the evening he needs to turn me down and if later on he needs to turn me up bc my mic won't activate."

You should probably get your eyes checked. Can you not read text more than a few feet in front of you?
How do you not notice you're deaf in one ear?
"The video is a great idea! He‚Äôs wary around strangers, so he‚Äôs pretty silent at his appointments. It‚Äôs hard to really explain how he ‚Äúcommunicates‚Äù, and a video would be the best example of it."
"He got tubes in in November, and it only helped his physical development. He‚Äôd been reaching milestones late since he was 4 months old which we just chalked up to the constant ear infections. He finally walked, and now he can keep up physically with all the other kids in his daycare class. He still only babbles, screeches, and what SOUNDS like words sound like they‚Äôre really guttural and muffled.

We‚Äôve moved since he got the tubes in, or else I‚Äôd take him back to his ENT. Its almost impossible to get in with one without a referral where we live. His ped said she‚Äôll ‚Äúconsider‚Äù a referral if it‚Äôs still an issue at his next appointment in September."
How do you do the shrug?
They were praising how they yell at girls at bars.
That *would* explain why it usually happens in the dead of winter.
Funny enough I could never hear anything putting shells to my ear.
It‚Äôs so boisterous that sometimes I even startle myself. I‚Äôm pretty easy going/more of the strong silent type and my friends say I‚Äôm the big friendly giant but when I need to I can turn into the hulk.

Whatever you say man. It's your money.
"In their defense, a lot of subs go downhill because they get flooded with posts that don't fit the context of the sub and aren't properly moderated."
They are probably not even humans
Lol okay whatever you say. I‚Äôm just pointing out that people love to say ‚Äúsub has gone downhill‚Äù when it hasn‚Äôt really. People have been doing that since the beginning of reddit.
This is cringier than the comment you replied to.
90% of this sub is what you just described

"I don't think that's a fair standard, given the only thing keeping 98% of Reddit from fitting that category is neck fat. (And let me tell you, I was one hell of a well-padded eight year old. I can assure you from much experience getting bullied: fat kids just *bounce*.)"
This is the dumbest fucking comment
"You are *severely* underestimating both the imagination and sheer randomness of 8-year-olds. You are talking about people who still haven't finished the neurological process of being language sponges. Sorry, yeah, there are plenty of parents who exaggerate the cleverness of their children, but in this case... I think you just don't know kids."
True. But he can deliver a good shin kicking.
"I thought you were a robot pretending to be human.

"It's more that the light colors would blur more with the background, I'd think."
"Nope. Unless it‚Äôs really big letters, mostly blur.

I‚Äôm getting worried, I always thought this was just normal."
"You get used to it and your other ear adapts. Mostly deaf in my left, but I typically forget cause I still hear everything all around me; it‚Äôs just quieter and I gotta let people know. Could def see how you could go without realizing, especially if it‚Äôs always been like that"
"I'm mostly deaf in my left ear. My mom is partially deaf but refused to ever get treatment until this year. Growing up with everything having the volume super cranked damaged the hell out of my cillia. When I got my hearing tested because I had so much trouble on phone calls and at restaurants the doctor said my ears were internally perfect aside from all the crushed cillia and had a bunch of students check out my ears (university hospital) ... She asked if I worked in a factory or grew up near a railroad or went to a lot of concerts. Nope. Just a mother who said hearing aids made her claustrophobic. (she has no issue in elevators or planes or anything...)

Now that I know, I don't notice it as bad, I have to use speakerphone whenever I'm on the phone because I need both ears to hear to be able to get everything. I don't use ear buds because I usually buy cheap ones and then when one side doesn't work it's super annoying."
"Try to get someone else to film you and him communicating, not just you waving a phone in his face. That was its easier to tell things like where he‚Äôs focusing attention, anything he‚Äôs gesturing at, etc. 

Again I can‚Äôt stress enough though that I doubt they‚Äôll be alarmed at this point. This is just some overkill level of being sure, which is worthwhile if it‚Äôs gonna put your mind at ease. 

At the very least you can find out if your doctor is shit, if they just dismiss the idea without explanation and aren‚Äôt willing to see the video lol."
"I second the recording.  My son at 3, had previously been able to speak,  then over time became babble.  His tonsils and adenoids were blocked and  it impeded his speech. My youngest didn't talk until over two,  but hers was for different reasons developmental delay . I'd recorded both , and son, the drs could hear the nasal blockage from adenoids,  (I knew about the swollen tonsils,  but never knew it could block speech) they got removed.  

 and they weren't concerned about my daughter.  (She's still got a speech impediment at 8, but therapy and singing is helping)  but the recording sure helped the Drs understand what was going on."
"On iOS I went to settings -> General -> keyboard -> text replacement, and I added two:

‚Äò.shrug‚Äô gives me `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø` 

And now ‚Äò.shrugr‚Äô gives me `¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø`

I also have ‚Äò.lenny‚Äô set to `( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)` lol"
"I use the . Prefix to denote symbol shortcuts. You can also do things like change omw to say On my way! Or anything else really. If you‚Äôre in high school you can take your moms phone, change ‚Äúno‚Äù to ‚Äúyes‚Äù, then text her and ask if you can go to a party to get really drunk and do drugs. 

Or you can do common misspellings, or words autocorrect likes to pretend you meant something else with. This overrides autocorrect. Also, you can override the shortcut with the text prediction bar. The literal thing you type is in the left, with the thing it‚Äôs a shortcut for in the middle, so if you hit space it‚Äôll automatically swap it, just like autocorrect."
"Makes it easy to get everyone's attention while out and about though. I used to whistle sharply to get my family to hear me, now I'll just loudly exclaim ""Autobots, roll out!"" And friends, family, and the odd car follows along."
"Please, don't call yourself a ""strong silent type"". It will save yourself from a lot of cringe."
"Yeah I'm a bot, bleep bloop"
That exists.

"Had two eight year olds with me at a cottage the last two days. Fucking kids are just mean to each other sometimes. Could not believe the adult sounding and terribly hurtful stuff they were saying.

Just no empathy or filter yet, but more vocabulary and knowledge than you'd expect."
"But it's not the level of diction, is the content of what he said that I think it's too much for an 8 year old to come up on the spot. Many adults would struggle to come up with something so clever out of nowhere.."

"So... you became partially deaf because your mom was?

"It's not that clever... he just said yelling was his normal voice. That's something a lot of kids think about, because they get told to speak in 'inside' voices, or such, all the time. ""I'm free"" is something they say a lot too. Characters say such in a lot of animated movies."

"[Found his Wikipedia article, but it's in Spanish.](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pr%C3%B3spero_Pinz%C3%B3n)

Google Translated the first paraphraph:

>Prospero Pinz√≥n Romero (Hatoviejo, 1856-Bogot√°, 1901), better known historically as General Prospero Pinz√≥n, was a doctor of jurisprudence, a civilian and military jurist, statesman, newspaper founder, and Colombian military born on January 1, 1856 in the population of Hato Viejo, Canton of Ramiriqu√≠, Province of Tunja, Republic of New Granada; today Villapinz√≥n in the Department of Cundinamarca, named in honor of his services to the Nation.

"A lot of people are done with the DFF Discord under its current leadership, namely Ashely and Kurumi. These reasons include but are not limited to: the great Minecraft drama, which Ashley fueled and led to Bunyip's removal as a mod, and Ashley and Kurumi throwing their graphic sexual exploits in #general. Many feel the latter was done to guilt Paul, since Ashely and Kurumi went as far to talk about it using Paul's name and comparing dick size. Many people wanted to start anew, so Spec and Keni made a new server and invited people to it. We recruited the DFF's 10 mods and did a multi-level strike on the original DFF server. Everyone did their job. There were many people involved, but without Spec and Keni giving up their status in DFF, it wouldn't have been as successful."

"His son, Thomas Pinzon, foundered at sea and was adrift for three days before being discovered, unconscious, by Jesuit priests on an island in the South Pacific. The priest who healed him was well known for his musical ability, in particular as pertained to Gregorian chant, but the stricken sailor was so close to death that the priests called his recovery the *magnum opus* of the priest. The sailor enjoyed the tag so much that he adopted the moniker as his new last name.

Sixteen years later, at the age of thirty-seven, that man was killed in the Battle of Pearl Harbor. His pregnant wife would name the son after his father, and Thomas Jr.  came into the world.

His father's best friend, a foreign attach√© in Honolulu at the time of the air raid, reoriented his life post war and pledged to raise young Thomas as his own, albeit from afar, in his stiff British manner.

That man's name was Jonathan Quayle Higgins III. The years of his service to the young boy have been lost to the vagaries of time, but the life of the adult Thomas Jr has been immortalized in an American television series, on two separate occasions.

Tl;Dr: that guy's grandad's mustache reminds me of Tom Selleck's."

"Prospero Pinzon's also had a famous  great grandson who was known for being instrumental in bringing down drug king Pablo Escobar.  He provided key intelligence on Escobar's inner workings. However his achievements were only posthumously recognized by the government in 1998.  The government back then did not see eye to eye with Pinzon's 'liberal' views of rights for LGBTQ, rights of women, and climate change being a serious problem.  Pinzon's very open and public criticism against the government did not help this relationship. The fact remained that the national police force had faced many defeats at the hands of Escobar, and so any intelligence provided by Pinzon's was not ignored. After Escobar's defeat and after a new government was elected, did they listened to the son of Pinzon's request to give his late father credit.  They finally listened in 1998.  Here is a picture of Pinzon at 52 standing next to a picture of himself at 45 after having time travelled many times to help himself gain fame. I'm an accountant by trade and I obviously made this story up.  Go time travellers!"

"You might want to check out some of the cases of identical twins separated at birth:

[https://www.livescience.com/47288-twin-study-importance-of-genetics.html](https://www.livescience.com/47288-twin-study-importance-of-genetics.html)

>When the twins were finally reunited at the age of 39 in 1979, they discovered they both suffered from tension headaches, were prone to nail biting, smoked Salem cigarettes, drove the same type of car and even vacationed at the same beach in Florida.

But this kind of thing shouldn't really be that surprising, because *all* traits are produced by the interaction of genes and environment. So yes, moustache preference definitely has a genetic component. Of course, there will be a whole bunch of genes involved here, and it will be highly sensitive to the environment in ways that are impossible to predict. There isn't a ""gene for a handlebar moustache preference"" in the way that there is a gene for sickle cell anemia. Rather, it might be that somebody's personality inclines them to be contrarian, and they're living in a culture where the handlebar moustache is considered uncool, so they're attracted to that style."
I was thinking about the same shit. I think the Gene's in that area have been pretty insular in the last 100 years or so

"it does mean the compilation of appearance in that gene strand stayed together. I am made of 13 countries.. 42% scottish irish and 30% french and know absolutely nothing or have any stereotypical traits of either. In fact I am shrugged off as greek/italian, even eastern.  high melanin in the skin. My grandma was a redheaded italian. My mom was nearly 100% french. I emerged as an image of my grandpa (literally 100% irish)..and look like no one else in my family. Not even character of life is any resemblance.. in fact I happily live far away. My dialect, thinking, attractions...food, relations... all different. The cloned appearance emerged anyway ..right down to very unique facial hair. An amazing read is of identical twins who share nothing the same but appearance. they even went to different countries to keep their head and heart happy."

Very impressive biography. You should be proud.
That's a compliment.
">I can grow it like that but every time I let it get bigger people tell me I have a '70s porn star mustache.

#AND?"
Don't let them win. That's a glorious beast he has. No mere porn star could have such luxurious facial hair.
That‚Äôs what I would say if I didn‚Äôt have a grandiose mustache like the painting.
A 70s porn star mustache + long side burns = mucho sexy time. Could be a good thing. Unless of course you match your user name ...
"That just means you didn't grow it long enough, to pass the 70s stache phase."
They're just jealous of the 'Stache. Embrace it.
My dad has had a mustache like your great-great grandfather since about the 70‚Äôs and it‚Äôs still glorious!
"Take pride in it. We are taking mustaches back from used car salesmen, retro porn stars, and oil tycoons. Breaking the mold! It‚Äôs a revolution everyday you bring that bad boy around."
Congrats on the luxurious mustache growing skills. I would take the pornstache complement any day with how my Joe Dirt beard comes in. Now it's going grey and its so patchy that I might as well cook some meth or shave it off.

I see that as an absolute win
And such majestic genes should be embraced

"He died the same year Theodore Roosevelt became president and interfered heavily with various Caribbean Nations. 1903 saw a civil war in Colombia that ended with Colombia and the US signing an agreement over the Panama Canal, but when the Colombian government didn't ratify the treaty the US directly supported the Panamanian independence movement, with control over the Panama Canal's construction area as a requirement of course. The term ""banana republic"" was coined around this time to describe countries like Honduras, totally enthralled to American fruit companies. [This political cartoon is from 1904](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1f/Tr-bigstick-cartoon.JPG), showing the gun-boat diplomacy of Roosevelt's administration. He was among the most imperialist presidents the US ever had. Had he lived long enough to see what Roosevelt would do in Colombia, I'm not sure if Don Prospero Pinzon Romero would appreciate the comparison."

"Hum, I haven't watched Twin Peaks yet, and I don't find Dark similar to X-Files. It's set in a small town and there's several main characters, it's also really awesome."
"If you enjoyed X-files and Twin Peaks, you'll likely enjoy Dark. There's less surreal stuff in Dark, compared to those two, I'd actually say it was very realistic. It's more about the relationships between the people of a small town, but it explores some fun concepts and does time travel far better than many other works that have tackled the subject."

"On like a beach or water park, yeah go topless. Just like how being shirtless in other public places is indecent for men, it would be for women.

Edit: Gold? Really? On this??? I'm not complaining just wow that was so easy"
"I think that when appropriate a woman should be allowed, yea. Like I don't really enjoy seeing shirtless men in the high street, but on beaches and a hot day in the park then sure, I see no problem with that"
"Yes. Though I wouldn't recommend it in my country as even in summer it's still a bit chilly.

EDIT: Thank you for all the upvotes! O_O I love you all <3."
"I think its impolite (improper may be better) for guys to walk around topless unless the weather and work calls for it, in those circumstances I have no issue with women doing the same."
A better question is: Should female nipples be censored on TV when male nipples are not censored?
"Yeah, why not? But as a woman, I  wouldn't do it because our culture can't handle it and the perving would be intense and uncomfortable from some people. In principle there's no problem with it though."
"Should they be able to? Of course. Would I? Nope.

1. Boob sweat is uncomfortable and a sports bra (I don't wear regular bras) absorbs that sweat.

2. If I need to run or jog somewhere really quick (not working out) then it hurts without support.

3. Even if it's legal, lots of men (and some women) will still leer and be creepy about it and I don't want to deal with that shit."
[deleted]
"To be clear from the start, this is actually legal in most of the USA.

That said, I agree that it should be legal. It‚Äôs a nipple. We‚Äôve all seen them. Barring terrible accidents we all have 2. Not one person in human history has ever been damaged by the sight of one. Consequently, I can think of no reason, other than fetishization, that women should be legally different from men in this regard, and the fetishization is self-perpetuating as long as it‚Äôs taboo."
"Women in my city fought for the right, got it, but never actually use this right."
"I would prefer that both men and women remain clothed in public. That being said if it's legal for a man, it should also be legal for a woman."
On a beach both men and women should be able to walk around topless. On the streets neither should. Although I don't think it should be illegal in either place.
"It's actually totally legal to go topless in New York- if I remember right it's only illegal if done for advertising purposes.

"My head says yes. Everyone free. No shame in human bodies. 

BUT tbh my heart says no. Equality is good but I would rather men just cover up too. The other day I was on the bus and this overweight older man got on, topless, dripping with sweat, white curly hairs everywhere....yuck. Don't really wanna see that, or sit next to it. Especially if I was eating or something.

EDIT: okay, I wondered if I should clarify the eating comment when I was typing, but thought it wasn't a big deal and people would get the meaning. Apparently not. Should've just explained properly as all anyone can say now is ""ew u eat on the bus""
I was referring to the same event occurring in an eating place. As in, a man visiting a caf√© or restaurant without wearing a shirt. I then thought, 'eh I guess people eat on the bus occasionally, so the point still stands', but overall the point is that anywhere somewhere is eating, they may be even less likely to want to see people in various states of undress. Personally I have eaten on the bus occasionally, if I have no time for lunch (though I only eat non-smelly, non-crumbly foods) but I don't make a habit of it, and it wasn't my main point."
I‚Äôve been living in Spain for 2 years now and women do exercise their right to topless and nobody really gives two shits and a popsicle
"I'd just as soon start with getting rid of the social expectation that women need to wear bras - topless is all well and good, but personally I get chilly and need the clothes (those who don't, you do you - let the puppies out!) But bras suck.

Edit: I am by no means saying no women should ever wear bras - those who want to or have to 100% should! 

I do, however, feel there is still a social expectation for women to wear them, at least in specific environments (ie, work, school), because it's considered indecent/inappropriate not to. Some women with smaller, less bouncy chests are able to not wear bras and have no one be the wiser, but it's pretty obvious for others."
I mean tbh I don't want to see most men and their moobs either.
Depends on where it is beach sure offices no weddings why not as long as bride and groom are ok funerals unless deceased explicitly wants it best wear something
"I would love to, but I am afraid of all the unwanted attention I would get from men.
Bathed topless at the beach once. Never again."
"I've only seem trashy men walk around shirtless in public space, i assume the same would hold true for women but I believe they should have that option as well. As for beaches and such i 100% feel women should be allowed to be topless."
"Would make breastfeeding really convenient lol

Edit: too many ""really's"""
If they wanna to why not
"Yes, but IMO, ideally, everyone should keep their damn top on. Men included. 

Also children would be another story."
I didnt know shirtless fat men with bigger tits than women walking around in public was such an epidemic.
"I've never understood how we came to the conclusion that female nipples are sexual in nature, but male nipples are not."
"I mean, I don't really care, but I imagine most woman wouldn't want to, since they're not only used to using something like a bra, but the risk of being sexually harrased are unfortunate much bigger"
And yet if we had another Janet Jackson wardrobe malfunction situation it would be treated as a HUGE deal. What is technically legal and how society reacts are on two very different pages still
Idk that map says MO has topless freedom yet i have had officers talk to me for wearing a sports bra in public and not wearing shorts over a swimsuit. I have seen women get asked to move/leave/cover while breastfeeding in a park.
I want know what the secret message given to Rael by the UFO is now!
Damn even Alabama it's legal wtf
Lol@ Nevada being topless is 'illegal'. At least in Las Vegas it isn't enforced. I've seen a few women with nothing more than a mesh top.
What if you‚Äôre swimming? Do they wear those 30s mens swimsuits?
"In Germany too. Like construction or road workers are often topless working. Tho no one will give a shit and actually give them a ticket, but in theory."
What? In Malm√∂ I've seen guys topless without any problem
Happens every year during the pride parade in Toronto. I‚Äôve seen it happen exactly once when it wasn‚Äôt pride during Carabana.
"I saw one topless woman just after the law changed. It was at a big outdoor concert full of drunk people. A police officer quietly pulled her aside and, I presume, had a talk about whether this was going to end well. She put on a shirt.

A number of nursing mothers have benefited from the change in the law, I think. They have legal protection from being kicked out of various places if they very briefly flash some nipple while nursing."
Because most of us don't want to nor feel comfortable doing so. It is a secondary sexual characteristic after all and I guarantee you that most women who advocate for women having the right to be topless in public probably won't go out in public naked.
Having the choice or freedom to do something does not mean you have to do it. But having the choice itself still matters.
"I've seen one woman topless (in public, I totally get to see boobs all the time I swear) in Toronto at the high park Zoo. She was overweight and there were a lot of assholes yelling things about farm animals. Good on her she brushed it off, but if this is how the general public is going to act then we definitely aren't ready."
I feel like Montreal would take advantage of this. Quebecois people at least are a lot more open to skinny dipping and nudity in general than a lot of Anglo North America around them.
"Stigma

Aaaand...sorry to say, but the world really still isn‚Äôt too great with sexual crimes/sexism. Imagine the cat calls and ‚Äúpick up lines‚Äù that first lady would face

Also they‚Äôre for sure taking advantage of it on beaches! Lol"
Got to be proud of those tities
I like this comment.
"On behalf of everyone with vision, thank you for saving us all with your dignity"
"I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs illegal in any European country, and it is quite common, in some countries, for women to be shirtless for example on a beach or by a pool."
"""So throw off the chains of oppression!"" said he -  
""Be fairly unfettered,

He waited. 

""... I don't really want to,"" she said."
"It's legal here, too. In fact, Asheville had a couple of large rallies where women went topless. It really drew in the shallow men. I, myself, would appreciate it as it might help me get over my fixation. I might become inured to it, as in European countries. I made that argument after one of the rallies and a few of my male friends disagreed, one saying, ""I don't, because I like the *mystery*."" And I'm thinking, ""They're not your boobs, man."""
What'd you do with his head?
Seriously most of my male friends have bigger boobs than i so why can‚Äôt i be topless in this fuckin hellhole it‚Äôs humid and 110 today -_-
Can you give us an idea of how many creepy PMs you got from this comment?
Thats the spirit!
"Same, I think I'd confuse people more than be a distraction"
"RELATABLE. I feel like if I went topless, that'd make most people uncomfortable even though I'm 21 y/o. My brother and dad have bigger boobs than me. Genetics failed me."
[deleted]
"Same, I wouldn't because I think wearing a bra is more comfortable when walking around. But if people want to whip them out, why the f not. It doesn't cause people to enter a mindless animal state of lust, in which they lose all control (and if it did, that'd just reflect bad on them, not on the boob bearer). It's fat folds with nipples, if you interpret more into them than you would into obese men's boobs, that's on you.   
(Edit: wording)"
"Exactly. The ""no shirt, no shoes, no service"" rule should still be in place for places where there's food being handled ~~(that's the law where I live)~~ and honestly places of business too (though breastfeeding is a different story). If it's appropriate, it's appropriate.

edit: looked into it and it's not actually law, but most restaurants do request that you wear a shirt and shoes to enter their establishment. Either way, I think it's not unreasonable to ask people to wear shirts when eating in a public restaurant, our bodies can be kinda gross ngl."
"Question.  When I grew up (late 80s - 90s) it was very normal  for adult males in my family and family friends to not wear a shirt around the house, around the yard, when having parties, when talking to neighbors.  Is that just not as prevelant now or did I grow up in a weird place?  I live in an apartment complex now and I sometimes feel weird walking to my car to grab something without a shirt on (I'm a Male), and I'm not sure if I should or not, because I don't ever see other guys walking around with their shirt off... but that's what I grew up around."
"Same here, if it's not I appropriate, you do you."
"I was having this discussion with a friend, and she said ""there are *a lot* of unattractive women with *really* saggy breasts...""

But my counter point is there are also a lot of fat men at beaches, and they don't look any less disgusting."
"Yeah, like sure, men are allowed to be topless most places, but it's still kinda weird unless you're like at the beach or something where it makes sense. I don't get why it's different for women."
"If it weren‚Äôt for nipples, boobies would be pointless

Edit:   Wooohooo.  Gold and silver metals - or medals, depending on your point of view.  Thank you kind strangers for the recognition of a pointless line I have used many times but only just entered on reddit."
That's not necessarily a bad thing.
"Agreed. Or maybe a rule against going topless if you're going to sit in a chair/on the bus or something? It's fine if you're walking around outside, but please don't get seats sweaty. It's kind of like going to the gym and cleaning up after."
"It's not even comfortable for me, I personally never do it unless on a beach."
Censor female nipples with male nipples.
"On the flip side, I‚Äôve seen plenty of R rated movies with a little bush or camel toe. Big ‚Äòole donger flopping around will usually push you into the NC17 range."
"And cameras everywhere. People WILL film you without your consent.

Edit: yes, it‚Äôs legal to film someone but many do not want to end up in a spank bank, that‚Äôs my point"
"This right here. The view of topless woman is much different then men and people will definitely react with variation. It's not just a matter of; ""go topless like men, no problem.""."
I wonder if after a while (maybe too long tbh) the perving would desensitize and maybe the culture would lighten up?
Not legal in Utah? Color me red with surprise.

Harassment will happen legal or not and most people just aren't emotionally equipped to handle that shit. I know I'm not.
"Just because you have the right doesn't mean you won't be harassed and then blamed and shamed for it. Not worth it mostly, and in some places police will still harass you about it even if it's legal."
I agree. I‚Äôd say on a beach it should be acceptable
\#ImprisonTheNipple
"I agree the only exception being that if they‚Äôre on a run or something I‚Äôm not bothered if men or women go topless. Honestly, if it weren‚Äôt for the fact that boobs bounce an uncomfortable amount when you‚Äôre running, I bet more women would work out topless. 

I do yoga naked in my room. It‚Äôs so much better. I wouldn‚Äôt have the guts to do it topless in public tho"
"When they first legalized it in New York State, you would see topless women at festivals all the time.  Haven't seen that in 20 plus years now."
"OP must be disappointed, people are just repeating the exact same thing.

Looks like we won't get what we seek today.

To get the real answer, We'd all have to take acid and find a comfortable place to talk about how we feel."
"Usually, shoes and shirt are required for everyone when it comes to public transit and private business premises. But outside of that, it could be optional for everyone."
"Yeh I‚Äôm with you. Yes and no. 

If men can do it women should be able to as well. But at the same time it‚Äôs just gross and unnecessary when you see a man walking around shirtless in a non beach setting. I don‚Äôt care how good you look, there are shirts you can wear that cover you up and allow you not to overheat.

Edit - clearly need to make my context clearer - 
Shirts off for both genders when outside! If you are indoors - put a shirt on."
Why is it always the gross men are the ones that feel the need to be shirtless? And why does everyone assume the same wouldn‚Äôt be true for women as well? Like it‚Äôs always going to be the hot woman walking around shirtless. Get real. You know it‚Äôs going to be the female equivalent to the man this person saw on the bus.
"I can't stand being braless, they feel so heavy without the support"
Or for those of us that are melanin challenged lol I wouldn‚Äôt go topless because the thought of getting a sunburn on my nips terrifies me.
"Bra more comfy that letting them hang tbh, especially during sports"
I'm an H cup. Braless is not feasible for me beyond sitting on the couch.
My wife quit wearing one about 6 months ago. She'll occasionally use these pasty like things if the shirt is thin or shows her piercings or she expects it will be cold and they'll show.
I rarely wear one now tbh.
I want everyone naked at my funeral.
"Well yeah but, to be fair, it's the same for men in that way. In offices, no one is really permitted to be shirtless, whether woman or man."
"This post desperately needs punctuation.

Edit: is this better?"
"If u wanna too, wanna do."
As in they should cover up or no ? I have seen little girls topless at swimming pools or beaches and noone bat an eye since they didn't even have their breasts developed. It seems funny to me that little kids should wear bikini tops?? (except if it's a one piece suit)
"O yeah, during one of the recent winter olympics the woman in the French couples figure skating competition had a mild wardrobe malfunction where one of her nipples was revealed. It was shown live, then when the rerun aired they had censored it. I thought it was hilarious because you know the French would have no issue with it. I live in Ontario and I have no issue with it. We can watch blood and gore and rape on day television, but god forbid a nipple shows."
Puritanical TV regulations in the US are a whole different ball game.
Yeah cops tell citizens to stop doing legal activities all the time because most of them have absolutely no idea what the law is and just enforce their own personal feelings about how people should behave.
"Wether it is illegal or not is decided by the reason the person chooses to be topless. In Sweden it is not illegal per se to even be butt naked in public places but if someone reports it and court finds the action to be made to disturb or harass someone, you will be charged with indecent exposure.   
This is not common knowledge here and you will probably be stopped on sight even by an educated cop if you're butt naked. All men go topless on the beach and I would suspect no one has ever been charged for it actually."
"I guess it's the same as in Germany. It's usually not *generally* illegal to be naked, but if you're in a place where you can be sure to piss off people with your attire then you're violating the peace. So if you try to attend an opera even 30s swimsuits would be offensive enough to get you into trouble. On the beach you don't have to wear clothes at all."
Philadelphia has a naked bicycle ride where a hundred or so people ride their bikes across the city naked
"I honestly don't understand the uproar that happens in regards to breast feeding. Oh no she flashed some nipple. So fucking what? Don't stare, and just go about your day."
If you read the breastfeeding laws in most states that‚Äôs not being topless.  Being topless and showing nipple during breastfeeding are distinct things.  Most states you can breastfeed in public and it‚Äôs illegal to tell you leave for it.
Yeah but imagine being the kind of person being offended by seeing the nipple of a nursing mother?
"I'm going to wait until my boobs are really old and saggy and wrinkly, then I'm totally going to rock them out on the beach."
"Yeah, having the right to do it is one thing but there has to be a MAJOR paradigm shift with regards to sex and how the female body is viewed before women start to feel safe topless."
"I don't know if you're accusing them of hypocrisy or not. I don't think there's anything wrong with advocating for a freedom and then not taking advantage of it personally - it's about the principle, isn't it?"
"I think it's more about having the freedom versus using it, which is fair."
"As Gloria Steinem once commented, women should be able to walk around without any clothes on and still feel safe."
You start by legalizing it. You can't normalize it without that. We used to cover women's ankles for the same reason.
Sounds like she was ready. Badass.
Haven‚Äôt been to any parades but living in Montreal my whole life I have yet to see women do so
They are called Moobs.  Man boobs
Moobies
"Yeah it freaked my wife out a little when we went to a beach in Spain and half of the women there were topless.

I was just like, ""it's Europe, they do that here."""
"Well you got it half right, on the beach it's legal for both, on the street is supposedly ilegal for both. If you're a man it's often not enforced but my brother actually got fined for jogging shirtless, granted it was kind of a tourist-y zone."
"""But why such restraint?!"" He asked in surprise

"Lol, I accidentally desensitized my partner to my breasts by basically being half-naked whenever I'm home. I didn't mean to, but it is what it is. Now I use lingerie to get him excited about them again lmao"
"I love this response, thank you."
You're asking the real questions
H A C K S A W
You are now the funny mayor of this thread
He pulled a Dio Brando...
I ate it.
"You can‚Äôt control what other people find sexual or attractive, and you could apply that kind of reasoning to anything. There‚Äôs nothing attractive about a pretty face, it‚Äôs just a chunk of bone with muscle fibers and an epidermis layer slapped on. Pretty gross when you think about it"
Yeah it‚Äôs weird what human beings find attractive. Like a six pack is just bumps on your stomach etc
"I agree that people are responsible for their own actions. It's on the person to not lust or grab. 

That being said, you could say that about any body part. ""It's just skin etc."" Breasts are part of the sexual experience for many people, both male and female. Many women enjoy their breasts being touched sexually and many men and women like touching them sexually"
I doubt that's a law where you live. Patrons of an establishment aren't held to the health code nor OSHA regulations in any state in the US.
"If the line to determine what behaviors should be legal was how much others would enjoy seeing the behavior, a lot of people would have to wear paper bags over their heads"
Being subjectively ugly shouldn't be the basis for a legal prohibition.
"I wanted to downvote on impulse for what your friend said. Since when does someone's attractiveness dictate their right to be seen in public? Seriously, what the fuck?"
"Not sure I'm following why how saggy your breasts are have to do with whether you should be allowed, by law, to show them or not?"
"Your friend is stuck on the idea that women's breasts are for other people to look at and enjoy sexually and that if those breasts aren't perfect, women don't deserve the privilege of showing them off."
It's almost as if women are people in their own right and not just objects to be displayed for the enjoyment of others.
"Someone's never lived in a rural area.

I have seen more shirtless men this summer than I have unique shirts."

"I read that as a Floridian, trust me, cold is not bad"

Underrated comment of the year.
"That might sound scary now, but if somehow it is no longer a taboo and people start going out topless who cares?"
"I mean, the ""attraction"" would still always exist, in the same way a gorgeous face or healthy hips are attractive; but yes the ""cant take my eyes off them ermahgerd so shocking and perverse"" aspect is heavily from the taboo of it.

If its normalized, people wouldnt look at them any differently than they would hips, faces, or general figure."
My boyfriend has 4!
Yeah i feel like the point of this law is so that a woman in unbearable heat is able to remove her shirt without getting charged
"Yes. There are exceptions. I am also fine with women breastfeeding pretty much anywhere, but do appreciate some discretion."
"Unless she's rather flat, I assume going for a run topless would be kinda uncomfortable for a woman.  Sports bras exist for a reason.

edit: typo"
It‚Äôs still going on. There‚Äôs a top less parade coming up this month.
[deleted]
"I feel like it depends on setting too. Beach? Everyone should be allowed to be show as much skin as you see fit (I mean swimsuits are basically covering no skin anyway). If you are on public transit, put a shirt on ya dummy."
"I suspect an interesting side effect would be that we‚Äôd get desensitised to boobs. and they‚Äôd be less sexualised. I don‚Äôt know if this is bollocks and I‚Äôm suuuper tired so not gonna google, but I read here that some African tribes where topless women is normal, they desexualised boobs and hypersensualised butts."
"And I wish we didn't limit clothing choices to ""but only if you look good in it"". Appropriate clothing for the situation should be independent from the wearer's age and beauty."
"Yeah me too. I mean its awesome if you don‚Äôt have to worry about what bra to wear with what shirt because you just don‚Äôt have to wear a bra, but sadly thats not an option for me and my boobs aren‚Äôt even ‚Äúlarge‚Äù"
Same here id hate not having to wear a bra. Idk if you can guess from my username hahah
And God forbid you try running without one
Being comfortable without a bra is the one upside to having tiny boobs.
"This isn't a fear I knew I had. I don't even have any intention of sunbathing topless, and somehow I still feel really uncomfortable that this is hypothetically possible.

Sooo, thanks...?"
It really depends on size.  I'm a 34A so I only wear one while exercising.
"My sister is I cup. She walk around the house braless, and personal I dont understand how it doesn't just tear off"
I want everyone naked at your funeral too!
I've heard that's the best way to not get uptight in front of a funeral.
I think the greater concern should be how she feels about it rather than the public.
"I still don‚Äôt get why TV shows don‚Äôt just CGI men‚Äôs nipples over the women‚Äôs nipples, that way they‚Äôre still censoring it"
A whole different boob game (FTFY)
What about going all naked? I'm totally in favor of allowing that as long as it is not done to harass anyone. Is that how it is in Sweden?
"So I cant rip my top off in the childrens play area of Ikea and start screaming about the return of Ph'nglui mglw'nafh R'lyeh, wgah'nagl?"
What if I disturb and harass people by shaking my man boobs at them while maintaining aggressive eye contact?
"I'm German, and I prefer our more vague approach of ""does someone feeling disturbed by it"" than having some weird, but clear-cut definition of what is allowed and what isn't.

Because these rules will be abused relentlessly. See the US and bare breasts with nipples covered with pasties apparently not counting as ""topless"" here and there. Which is of course ridiculous."
"Here's my only experience with the naked bike ride

That seems uncomfortable
"Fun fact; that happens in a lot of big cities. Here in Portland, we are apparently proud of being the biggest one, with around 10,000 participants every year.  
I learned about it while trying to drive through downtown one night, and being stopped to allow people to pass-it was a never ending stream of naked humans, cops were stopping them every few minutes to let drivers through.  
Also; since it's technically a protest, the nudity is protected and legal.  
The more you know."
We have that in Toronto too
Seattle‚Äôs Soltice Parade has naked bicyclists.  No bottoms.  Lots of body paint.
Chafing in places you should never be chafed
"I don't either. Almost every woman I've seen do it, doesn't just sit there with her breasts out and shirt pulled all the way down. And that always seems to be the argument - that kids will see and they shouldn't be exposed to that. 

Well, let's think about this. I have a 4 year old son.  I've changed in front of him. (I'm his dad by the way). We've been in a locker room and he had to go potty really bad so we walked through where some other guys were changing. If you make it weird, then it will be weird. In this kind of setting, he sees it as normal. 

If he saw some dude walking down the street naked, he'd have some questions. But that doesn't really happen. 

Now for what's being talked about here, my son has seen that too. He was breast fed for one. But even more recently as a little bit older kid, he still sees it. I think I can only remember one time that he asked and I just said that ""she's feeding her baby."" It's normal. Don't make it weird. Babies need to eat."
"As a man, the only issue I've had is a bit if personal embarrassment when I went ""oh, a cute baby"" and then realized said baby is attached to a boob (then got a dirty look as if I was perving on the mom).

I still support breastfeeding in public though."
"Also, I mean, not to be pedantic, but when women breast feed we are literally using our tits for what they are made for!

EDIT: I get it guys, your ass is for shitting and your dick is for cumming and pissing. Do we, as a society do any of those things out in public? No, obviously not. 

My tits are for feeding my child; do you eat in public? Then why can't my son?"
"As a mom who breastfed her kids, thank you! I got lots of uncomfortable looks from people though regardless of how discrete I was!

Edit: I always knew my boobs would get me my first reddit Gold!

Seriously though thank you stranger for the gold, and all you wonderful understanding people who also can't fathom why anyone would take issue with feeding an infant in public (especially when so many newborns and new parents struggle to properly feed their children in the first few months, including myself).

I want to also add that sometimes it's really hard to cover up while breastfeeding. For instances, our kids were little heaters as newborns and even with the thinnest cotton blanket I could find, they would often overheat. They'd also frequently unlatch and then I'd have to go under the blanket too, making it hotter and also knocking it off completely. This would become a nightmare of trying to keep us cool, the blanket on and the baby latched, when often, I hadn't eaten in hours and was trying to feed my baby while I ate. 

All I'm saying is I really wish we could get past this stigma as parenting a newborn is already hard enough, especially for first time parents. We aren't trying to disrupt society, but it would be nice to be able to go out in public (since new parents are often stuck at home) and just have a meal in peace without worrying about what people think.

And to those of you who are worried about looking or staring. Sure, please don't stare, but it's fine to look. Even as a women I notice a boob out in public, it's only natural. But just accept that it's there, and move on with your day. 

Thanks again to you fine people!"
Exactly! Do these people forget that the nipple was flashed because the woman is trying to feed her baby?

"Yeah I might be free from being under arrest but I won't be free from angry old people telling me to cover up, cackling whoops, creepshots, dirty glares from parents shielding kids' eyes, and whole host of unpleasant public reactions that topless men wouldn't be subject to.

Legal isn't really the same thing as publicly accepted."
"This is the thing exactly. The problem isn't ""women want to go topless everywhere but can't"". Instead the problem is ""the women who want to be topless at times in public can't""

EDIT: To clarify, the issue of toplessness has both the social side and legal side. I think many people think that women just want to run around topless when they hear this discussion, but really it's more that it's currently illegal for a woman to have her breasts visible in public for any reason (not in all places, that is)."
"Right. It has to start somewhere. Once it‚Äôs more normal to see, then it just becomes normal. Everything takes time."
"I lived outside Montreal so I don't know if people would ever swim in the river. But a lot of Quebecois people will come to New York and Vermont for boating on our lakes and partake down here.

Not in All countries..
"Depends totally on the town/city. 

Some cities along coasts try to establish a more ""serious"" image, so they banned walking around topless and in just your swimsuit (e.g. Barcelona). Unless your actually at the beach, of course."

"""You thought we were talking about breasts, but it was me, Dio!"""
"Yeah, I absolutely hate this ""it's just fat""-logic. By the same token why isn't full nudity allowed? Our genitals are also just skin and fat, with lots of blood when we are aroused. Boobs aren't just fat anyway, they are also made of breast tissue! If we use this kind of cellural reasoning, then instead of last breasts are probably the first body part we should cover up. I honestly think this fat-argument is tied to the shame most women feel about weight. From a heterosexual male's perspective I also have no sexual preference to muscle over fat, which makes the argument feel so weird and flawed."
So true. Consider hair: Eyebrows are a necessity. A thick head of hair is even considered beautiful. Long eyelashes are sexy. Facial hair on a man can be handsome. Hair on shoulders / back on the other hand are mostly considered as unappealing.

"Quietly, in the heads of ugly people, for their entire lives.

I wear long sleeves and sweat to death in the summers because I've slowly internalized the idea that nobody wants to look at my hairy arms and arm pudge, to the point where I feel ashamed, naked, and uncomfortable without sleeves on in public."

"Recently listened to an interesting podcast called Ologies that mentioned in places with less shame around sex, everything is less sexualised. The example given was Thailand, whose porn more resembles actual sex presumably for this reason."
I doubt it. Topless men are sexualised because they‚Äôre topless. I don‚Äôt think topless women would desexualise boobs.
Lol I have so many friends with small boobs that when we have sleepovers after a night out tell me that I can get comfortable and take my bra off. I bring a slreping bra or sports bra to sleep in because it just hurts to not have one on at all. 42 DDD
"Dude, I have B's and its still uncomfortable for me to be braless. Walking up and down stairs without a bra is painful."
"Definitely agree. I'm a 34B and like wearing a bra if I am working out, but that's it. Otherwise I love the freedom and comfort without one."

"Absolutely. Though I'm honestly not sure the American system can handle this. If you end up with such things in front of a professional judge (or judges if you appeal) you have someone who actually knows not only the law, but also the intention behind it, several expert opinions and probably has already had several similar cases. For juries you clear-cut laws might be necessary."

"Thank you! I was nursing my month old baby in the backyard just yesterday, chasing around my toddler. We live in a townhome community so we were in the shared area in the back. I wasn‚Äôt using a cover but no one was outside. My husband said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre just getting real comfortable out here eh?‚Äù And I‚Äôm like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm feeding our daughter in the yard! Calm down!‚Äù"
"When I was 18 and working my first retail job at a bookstore in the early 2000s, I had a mother of a newborn ask me where she could breast feed. I told her anywhere she felt comfortable and mentioned that we had some comfy chairs nearby that I could show her to. She nearly cried thanking me for ""letting"" her breast feed in the actual store.

All I could think was: what the hell were people telling her in the 3 weeks that she'd had a child that that was her response? They're babies, they need to eat!"
"I notice more people breastfeeding now (I work in a cafe) than I did a few years back (last time I worked in a cafe) and I think it‚Äôs great women are feeling comfortable to do so, it‚Äôs perfectly natural, and babies need food. People just need to leave it alone and mind their business. 

I find it really bizarre that as a species, we are so uncool with our own milk and that we are so sex focussed that people freak out about body parts being used for their primary function."
"It's truly bizarre that breastfeeding has been stigmatized in that way, I don't quite get it, but be assured that the problem is entirely with THEM and they need to deal. Source: my wife and most of our female friends have breastfed and I would bend over backwards to make sure they feel totally comfortable doing so wherever they want."
"Sort of like old dudes in mens locker rooms who dgaf anymore, from what i hear"
"This is one of the advantages of getting older as a woman--you simply no longer give a flying fuck whether or not anyone thinks you're ""hot"", and don't particularly care about a lot of other stuff, too.  Personally, I still kind of care about my boobs sagging, but then, they're rather large to start with thanks to heredity (or no thanks, really; smaller would have been fine by me), so that was going to happen no matter what anyway.

At any rate, as far as the ""whipping 'em out in public"" thing goes, even if it were legal, a lot of us would just as soon not.  It's my body, and my right to keep parts of it private, not to mention burning one's nipples apparently really, *really* hurts like hell, and I'm already a pasty enough white woman that I don't feel the need to find out *exactly* how painful it really is."
It‚Äôs easier to change legality than mass public acceptance

"There's a nice nude beach near San Diego. I've been a self conscious person for most of my life, so my SO was really surprised when not only did I try it, but I really enjoyed it. It feels great being topless under the sun.

There were definitely a few weirdos to make the whole thing uncomfortable occasionally - group of fully clothed tourist men walking the beach clearly just to look at women, gay guys wearing those strap things around their dick and balls and getting way too sexual, etc. But overall it was just a really chill vibe."

"I go around with my tits freely hanging out, but my schlong stays in my shorts."
"As an American who has visited a few European beaches, I get the impression most people are imagining a bunch of super models in their early 20s lounging on the beach. In my experience, only a small percentage of women were topless. Of those, there were some young, lots of middle-aged, some old, some skinny, some fat. None of them were making a show of it, just ""yeah I'm hanging out and not wearing a shirt, so?"" The fantasy is definitely more appealing than reality."
"It gets over exaggerated a lot but it's still legal in most European countries and no one really gives a shit if someone is topless at the beach or not.

I don't think that's the case in America."
I love you

It's not their fault they have 3 eyes
Leper colonies were terrible too.
The fact that I found a spouse that apparently finds me to be attractive leads me to the conclusion that there is nothing that is objectively ugly.
"I'm a girl, and when I was about 10 years old another girl in my class noticed my arms with dark, rather thick hair, and yelled to the class ""omg look, she's a gorilla!!!"" It was pretty scarring. So I shaved my arms for a few years. Then when I was 12-13 a different girl noticed I shaved, and asked why. I told her about the gorilla incident. This sweet girl said ""well they were a terrible person for saying that to you. Your arms are fine. Look, mine are hairy, too. They're what I've got, so I deal with it. I don't like shaving so I just decided I don't care what people think about my arms."" Made a huge difference to me. I stopped shaving my arms immediately, and just stopped caring what people thought. Easier said than done, of course. Took a few years to really not care anymore. But now I rock my hairy arms with no shame. It's better than long sleeves in summer, or prickly stubble all up my arms between shaves! 

Basically, your arms are great. They're beautiful the way they are, and nobody else gets to tell you otherwise. They're yours, and they're amazing. Enjoy your arms, hair and pudge and all!"

"That reminds me of a story where an old lady calls the police on a bunch of adolescents swimming in a lake naked. The police just tells the adolescents to move up 2km where they are behind the trees and out of sight. Then an hour later the police man gets another call from the same lady about the same adolescents. He sees that the adolescents are swimming where he told them to and tells them to take a brake. Then he goes to the old lady and asks how she could even see the adolescents. She proceeds to show the police officer, that from a window in her roof she could see the adolescents using binoculars.
End of story.
The old lady will argue that the naked adolescents disturb her. My common sense argues, that ""being disturbed"" should not count if the disturbed person had to put active effort into gaining that disturbedness."
"My understanding is that ""obscenity"" per the SCOTUS is a standard set by the community. Thus if the community tolerates topless women then that would be legal"

He stopped pretty fast when I told him I was fifteen.

No idea who thought it‚Äôd be a good idea to put him in a high school cafeteria where the vast majority of students are minors."
I was on leave and filling my gas tank when a recruiter approached me and gave me the spiel. The look on his face was interesting when I told him I was already in the Army.

He said to me, ""He shouldn't do that."" I asked what he was talking about and he said they were girls shoes. It totally made sense because he mostly only sees women wearing shoes like that. 

But I basically said, ""It's ok. Different people wear different kinds of shoes. Like I like to wear these sandals a lot but sometimes I wear my running shoes. Maybe he just likes those."" 

That seemed to make perfect sense to my son."
"Exactly. Adults make it weird. My daughter is three years old and she pulled her shirt down and stuck her baby doll to her chest the other day while playing. I don‚Äôt know why people think it‚Äôs taboo to breastfeed. Bottle feeding isn‚Äôt natural, boobs are."
"And even if they don‚Äôt eat from boobs, they‚Äôre still laying on them. That skin to skin stuff is important!"
And have actually touched at least one vagina... with their whole body...
And many toddlers will just grab their mothers tops and pull them down because it's just a piece of cloth to them
"Yeah.. this is actually something that frustrated me while growing up. Any time the family was watching a movie or TV show that just *might* feature a nip slip, my mother's hand would fly so god damn fast over my eyes you'd think Medusa herself appeared in our living room. But then we would watch Final Destination and it was perfectly acceptable for me to watch a man be sliced into 5 pieces by razor wire, but seeing a nipple at that age just would be too much for my little brain to comprehend....

Theres no good reason to shelter your kids from seeing the human body. All its gonna do is make the kids ask questions that the parents don't want to answer. Which results in the kids seeking that information elsewhere."
"Not to mention it's kinda wise. 

Puberty can be super scary and at least where I live teens and young adults constantly worry about if their perfectly normal bodies are in fact normal. Now I'm not saying show them a line up of vaginas but things like boob size/shape, streach marks and not having an ideal body are all important. 

We have this phobia of nude bodies and it is helping nothing. Instead kids basically only ever see people nude in porn or on your typical photoshopped magazine cover. These are not realistic or ideal sources of information. 

There are non sexual ways to broach even sexual parts. Channel 4 had a labia gallary a while back. 100 non-sexual and frankly somewhat clinical full frontal pictures of vaginas. It has been used as a resource for 'am I normal' countless times."

But not inapropriate for children to suck on... Hmmmmmmmmm
"Back in Philippines, I lived in the slums and mothers breast fed their children outside since it's like an oven indoors during the day.  Not one child was traumatized nor did any adult male lose their senses over this regular display.  

Suffice to say, it's documented that this view of inappropriety is from puritanical Americans via cultural exchange, especially more so now with Hollywood eg: Japan used to have mixed baths with women's breast not being sexualized even in their shunga (pornographic prints) since they viewed the breasts as child-rearing tools.  It wasn't until their borders were forcefully opened by Perry that it became a country that sexualized breasts."
"As Sarah Silverman points out: clevage is okay. You know, the meaty part that men like that you can use to sandwich a hard cock. That's fine. But the life giving nourishing nipple is obscene and must be hidden and removed from dolls"
"This is perfectly appropriate until you are weaned, then, nipples are sexy and you shouldn‚Äôt see them, then, they become normal again when YOU have a baby and the weird-ass cycle starts all over again!

I haven‚Äôt had a baby so I‚Äôve been in ‚Äúmy nipple are sexy‚Äù mode for entirely too long, according to some people. If you haven‚Äôt had a baby by 30, your ‚Äúsexy‚Äù nipple factor goes up by 10 and you have to cover up extra so people don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre just a washed-up prostitute."

"I feel ya. Not totally related but I had a similar incident when my male (& then only in boxer shorts) flatmate walked into me in the kitchen (only in bra and pants - its been hot in the UK recently).

Me: (not missing a beat) Hello naked MaleFlatmate

Yes, you live here, I live here. We both have a right to be naked in our own fucking house."
"Jesus. That's so sad. It's crazy to think that someone got that emotional for being ""allowed"" to feed their newborn baby... 

And I don't mean the mother is crazy. What's crazy is that society has gotten to the point that she first off felt she needed to ask if she could do it, then was shocked that you said she could wherever felt comfortable. 

People need to stop thinking about the adults here. They need to think about that baby. If the baby needs to feed, then there shouldn't be one single person who would say, ""No, don't let the baby eat."" We need to look at this for what's best for that little child."
"I also worked retail and also could care less if your tiddy is out feeding your new human. Ive had customers ask me to ask that person to go somewhere private. And i had to tell them management has explicitly said it is okay for women to breastfeed wherever they please as long as they cover themselves up. We announce that we have specific rooms if the mother chooses but this is america and we cannot force someone into a room if theyre complying to the rules when breastfeeding. Our store is 400,000ft sq. so maybe just avoid that particular 20ft sq. 

I just about had it with customers trying to tell me whats okay and whats not okay with the store. I couldnt care less and customers were never right.

The point of my story is that whether its the places that woman was may have also had customers in an uproar. If she politely asks and is accepted to feed and has the establishment behind her, then she knows another customer cant really have her asked to leave. And thats got to be a great feeling."
"And we ALL WERE BABIES. 

I feel like there should be some unwritten universal rules which should apply to everyone, everywhere. Like even if a mother is nursing inbetween a warzone, she should be untouchable. Or... you just do NOT litter. Or... water is universal. Or.. if a company cannot take care of it's waste, it should not get a green light. Or... pick your shit and you dog's shit up. Or... if you take a tree down, you must plant a new one... Stuff like this."
"Way back when i was in high school, i was a server at Denny's. I remember a family came in, and when i was walking up to the table to take their order, she had a boob completely out and she was feeding her baby. She didn't have a blanket or anything covering her. Her husband was this giant, bald headed tattooed scary looking guy and i was this awkward scrawny 17 year old. I was so nervous i didn't know what to do. I just stood there sweating, maintaining unbreaking eye contact with the father lol.

He was looking at me like he was daring me to look at his wife's boob. I took the entire families order never once looking away from this man's eyes lmao. It was so awkward back then but it's hilarious to think about now."
"I blame formula manufacturers who made it feel taboo and unnatural to breast feed, in order to sell their product."
It's 'coz the sexualization of breast in women. They are not genitalia but are treated as such by everybody. That mindset needs to change before any progress can be achieved.
It's a marketing ploy to keep formula company's rolling in the dough
This absolutely the case. I've seen so many old man penises just flopping around in the locker room at the gym

"My son did that too when he was little. It's something he sees sometimes. And he played""family"" (that's what he'd always call it and I thought that was super cute). He'd push the baby in the stroller, cook food for me, change the baby's diaper, feed the baby.

">Which results in the kids seeking that information elsewhere.

Can confirm, parents made sure not a single nude person was seen/answered questions about bodies and grew up to have some pretty weird interests since I tried to satiate my curiosity alone, which lead me down a few rabbit holes."
"That last part reminds me of a documentary I watched about penis' once. It was designed to show men that they come in all shapes, sizes, and even colours, and it was shown in a gallery, with a chance for some men (if they felt comfortable) to take a photo whilst there (in a stall) to add to the gallery. I still remember some of the brilliant photos, one guy decided to make it look like a breeches whale, which stuck in my mind for the idea being so original. I think at times we should have these types of galleries pop up, and allow people to take a look and to know its normal to look like this or that. If needed, call it the medical art galley presentation or something, and add in stuff people worry about but is normal."
I'm sure she didn't thumbpick that spot to intentionally flash anyone. She might've been just sat there when her baby wanted to feed and moving was too much of a hassle.

At what age do adults start looking at again, LITTLE BABIES, saying ""She absolutely cannot have her NIPPLES out, that's INDECENT!!!""  


Because obviously this age starts long before a young woman actually starts developing any sort of breasts. When the fuck are people looking at a growing child and say ""Yup, today is the day that it's actually inappropriate for you, young girl child, to show your nipples, because it's a sexual object and they must not be seen or else you're A NASTY WHORE!"""
"Lots of replies to this comment seem to miss the sarcastic tone, but the message is clear: North American society's rules for nipples are puritanical and logically inconsistent. They're okay to show briefly during breastfeeding because they are serving their ""purpose"", but otherwise should be hidden. ObViOuSlY, it is the woman's responsibility to not be a source of temptation."
"Hahaha, it sounds like we married the same pervert üòÇ
He means well, but it‚Äôs not my fault somebody decided feeding an infant was risqu√©."
...neither of you was naked in that situation
"..but you were both the opposite of naked, you had both covered the traditional respective naughty parts if I read you correctly."
"I was offered a bathroom many many times when I asked where I could nurse. Twice in doctors offices. That was 6 years ago. 

With my second baby I didn‚Äôt ask. Just nursed whenever she needed it and I could get comfortable."
"It's a crazy world we are in.

There once was a time when women were expected to stay home. In these times wet nurses would come and feed your kid from their breast, so a mom could do other things.

Now, women are expected to run errands and work and wet nurses is disapproved of, yet heavens forbid a woman still feed her child outside of her house."
I had the same thing happen the other day. This person was snacking while he said it. I told him if he could eat in public so could the baby.
"Honestly fuck the covering up too. It‚Äôs a nipple. People who have problems with that should seek therapy or get over themselves, but the choice to cover or not should be up to the mother. Some babies won‚Äôt have it."
Can you legally require a nursing mother to cover up? I thought they have the right to nurse covered or uncovered.
"I supervised a coffee shop a few years ago and we had a customer go into early labour in the female toilets whilst I was on shift. Shut the place down, called an ambulance etc immediately as there was something very clearly wrong. She nearly lost the baby and lost so much blood that she almost died herself. 

First time she came back into the store about two months later she breastfed the baby on one of our sofas whilst waiting for her drink. An absolute ass of a man berated her for it. He had no idea what that woman had been through to even be able to be sat there. 

Told him I wouldn't be serving him his food if he was offended by others eating and he could find somewhere else."
That's a great idea. We should have a list!
"I breastfed both of my sons for a year each, back in 2002 and 2004.  My parents formula fed my brother and I, who were born in the 1970s.  I think it's a generational thing because my parents were VERY uncomfortable whenever I needed to feed my babies at their house or in their presence."
"Plus this weird way that we Americans over sexualize things. Boobs are okay to show on television, just as long as you blur out those areolas."
"Ive had an old dude have a full on conversation with me while he was butt naked, schlong hanging out, right next to me. I never broke eye contact."
Must be nice. I cant really get away with not wearing one. A little too big and honestly I get enough subtle glances and stuff as is. Besides.... without it stairs hurt like the dickens.
We have to wear pasties which for us is this nude colored tape that we put makeup on to look like a nipple.

Holy shit what a twist.
"She stood in the wreckage, 

The gore at her feet.

She inhaled her glory,

Grinned at their defeat.


For now they were silenced,

No more demeaning demands.

She dusted her dress,

Wiped the blood from her hands.


She stepped over the bodies that lay on the ground,

She turned to her friends, who'd not yet made a sound

""Are you ready?"" She asked.

""Its our time to rise,"" she gestured her hand across all the dead guys.

""Now we are free, now we can undress; 

no more men to make comments or try to oppress.""


And one by one they did strip,

Unbuttoning blouses.

Their clothes littering the streets, 

And the alleys, the houses.


Off with their camis,

Away with their shapewear,

Good riddance to bralettes,

Hasta la vista to skin care.


They wiped off their make up,

They let down all their hair,

The real freedom was found 

When they went totally bare 


And the leader, she raised up her arm in the air

Brandishing a symbol of all women's despair

""With this razor I vow, I solemnly swear,

To go forth in the world with my natural hair!

And never again to shave a leg or a pit,

Unless I fucking want to,

Cause men don't run shit!""


And an eruption of cheers from the mass of nude women,

Who rallied and rioted and went forth with new vision

Of a world without sexually frustrated men

Shouting jeers at the lasses like pigs from a pen


For now they were beaten, 

their bodies lie shaking

And the women marched forward,

Naked - but by their own making."
And the perverts fucking died

"My son has a baby doll. My conservative family acts like I'm ruining him by letting him play with ""girl things"". He's a better parent to that baby doll than some of my family is to their real kids."
"To be fair my mom was the worst about this, while my dad never really cared. I used to ""go to bed"" and wait until I hear my mom go to bed, then sneak into the living room and watch horror movies with my dad. One night he was channel surfing and the Grudge was playing midway through, and when he hit play it was the scene where the ghost kid jumps up from the end of the bed. 

I screamed, dad screamed from both the jump scare and seeing me behind him because I'd just walked in. And that was the last time I watched a horror movie with my dad after dark, so I guess my mom assumed that problem would sort itself."
"Excuse me, but GOOD GOD-FEARING AMERICAN CHRISTIANS ***WOULD NEVER BREASTFEED A CHILD***. That's horrific. Don't you sit there implying American Christians are incestuous!

Where I'm from we have this same law - so strippers wear clear pasties lol
"Does it not have something to do with nipples being ‚Äòerectile tissue‚Äô.

Honestly I find the limitations on US strip clubs to be odd and laughable.  In Canada it‚Äôs to the buff,.. I‚Äôd feel confused if it was anything less."
"I think the idea is that the nipples are the identifying trait of titties, so that's the illegal part."
ALL ABOARD THE SEXY NIPPLE TRAIN!
Even Mormons and Amish people wouldn't consider that to be naked.
"They, like everyone, was naked under their clothing."
"Bathrooms are the grossest place to feed an infant.  I‚Äôm not sitting, fully clothed, on a toilet that someone else has peed on at some point since it was last cleaned with a disinfectant, in a stall full of human waste micro spray, while being forced to smell the person who‚Äôs currently shitting in the stall next to me, to feed my baby who‚Äôs immune system is years from being fully developed.   

When the people that suggest this see no problem eating their own lunch this way, then we‚Äôll talk."
Completely agree with you extremely strange to be so offended by a body part. It's so bizarre that people get wierd about it or that children shouldnt see them ffs they are there for feeding children. If the world ended tomorrow and there was no formula how do people think babies would be fed. It is how they were designed to feed. Plus the cover thing defo doesnt work I'm still nursing my 2nd child and no way would he accept being covered up. I dont blame him though i dont like to eat under a blanket either ü§£ü§£ no one has ever said anything to me about feeding my baby in public but I would almost love someone to try they would get some earful!

"We have this in Texas. Pasties = they serve booze, butt naked = BYOB. It has more to do with our wierd liqour laws than skin laws"
"My husband told me about how you can't actually get naked at all strip clubs. It blew my mind. 

I grew up in Oregon, where stripping is considered protected under the 1st Amendment. So everything comes off. I actually think it's legal to be naked in public in Oregon as well. As long as you don't touch yourself. If you do, it becomes indecent exposure. If you're just waking down the street or riding your bike fine, but no playing with yourself.

This is also why the Naked Bike Ride is hosted in Portland, or started anyways. I think it's expanded now."
If you're like me it's ghost-burn-ghost
"As a ginger who works a physical outdoor job, I've found that consistent, limited exposure every day will eventually build up a tan/put some color on my skin. What that look like for me is 7/8th of the day I wear long pants, long sleeves, and a shemagh, and for 1 hour every day (usually the last hour, so between 4pm and 5pm) I do a ball cap and a beater/no shirt depending on the job site.

Now, obviously just because i can do an hour in the sun every day doesn't mean everyone can, you gotta find what works for you, even if that's only 15mins or maybe even less. One of the key factors I've found is timing, between 11:30am and 3pm seems to be the most intense sun (at least in my Northern climate) so exposing yourself either before or after that will lessen your chances of burning.

"You're doing a good thing. It sounds like you know that, but it's still good to be reminded of it sometimes. You're a good parent. 

My son is 4 now and in the mornings when he wakes up, he'll come into my room and ask if he can play (sometimes it's at 3 AM and i have to tell him it's still time for sleeping... Lol). 

Anyway day after day right now, when he gets up he goes and sits on the couch. He just needs some time to wake up. And he sits there with the things that make him happiest. 

There he is with his Teddy Bear on his left side, his kid-sized Elsa doll on the right side and holding his Batman. 

The 4 of them quietly do pretend play while sitting there. It's the cutest thing for me to wake up to each morning. And it makes me incredibly happy to see him there. 

My number one job as a parent is to do everything possible for my son to be happy, healthy, and learning as much about the world as he can. And I'm proud to say that I think I'm doing a pretty damn good job."
"It is strange though. My son's 4 and he's into Batman. And he wants to ""play fighting"". It's weird that the cartoons have fighting like this and it's totally acceptable for a kid to watch it. But any kind of nudity is unacceptable."

"They were raised by a very modest generation. Despite how much changed in the 60's & 70's there was still a lot of discomfort over what is perceived as public nudity spilt over from the 40's & 50's. It'll eventually be normal, but as we work through that change we still have to deal with the criticism from the prior generations."
Its literally cultural remnants of Puritan settlers who helped colonize America.
Yes but the male review gets both
"Seattle same but it's because the mob still runs the strip clubs(I'm not crazy). They change the girls a per night fee that can be as high as 375 for a shift and take a percentage of lap dances. While also charging a door fee. If there is no alchole they can get away with a lot more shady business as well like selling drugs, prostitution, I'm sure a host of other illegal things. Since it's not controlled at all by any government body there is no need to check in on them other then making sure they keep there pasties on when they say so(which rarely happend). It's also a good way of making not main stream, under the guise of keeping the girls safe you put them more at jeopardy because if they cant pay the door fee they end up owing the club and that adds up quickly. They can also stick fees on the girls like their heels being to short, missing a shift they never took or maybe they did, calling out sick, not doing enough stage time, working less then 20 hours,(this could go on and on). A friend once owed 600 after a week of being sick. Plus no alchole means open 24 hours. I doubt the club owners want to change this I'm sure they make more money as they are paying for just one product that also pays them. In Portland it's different girls maybe pay a small fee or pay maybe a portion of lap dances but I haven't heard of both, and can make bank just from doing performances as they are usually near the bar. Patrons are bar people which makes it more normalized and they usually close after hours(not always but a good portion). There is no forcing lap dances or quota from what I hear but there is fierce competition as a lot of girls from surrounding states including Washington will go down there to dance. This is all info from friends who dance and still do, a friend wrote a thesis on why sex workers need more laws not less to protect them and tried to reinnatiate a collective of unionized dancers(it was a wonderful dream). Sadly as long as they prey on poor and generally extremely young girls we will see the same reality of workers we still do."

"It doesn't have to be cursive, but it should be reasonably neat."
I'm not suggesting it's the same person.
Yo that shit is objectively bad handwriting
"I don't think that's gatekeeping. If you work in a field where people have to read what you write, it's just worth putting in the effort to make your handwriting neater."
Honestly I liked all of them but I def see why it tapered off as it went. The sequels brought in some improvements but they lost the magic of the original as they went. Especially the third one. Second one was really good. As much as I love the third one it lost a lot of the magic.

Because have fun sticking to your longer method when you get to advanced calculus or other parts of math where finishing a single equation takes a whole page or more.
"Happened to me for physics. The equations were pretty long but the actual question was quite simple, so it was a lot easier to just use the relationship I knew physical properties have to each other than to derive the equation from what the test provided."

"Dude, when you get advanced you are happy you get an answer regardless of method or how many pages it took. 

Getting marked down if the math checks out is how you create negative emotions towards math."
They still have no reason to penalise you in exams if the method is correct.
I stand corrected.
No you get negative karma when you get down voted

"Sometimes I don't even understand what I wrote. It's like a different language looking at writing from years ago, especially fast writing."
"If it's to prove a point, please don't force yourself to have bad handwriting. One of the lesser known frustrations of adulthood is having to read illegible handwriting in order to make an important decision. This is why doctors are regular punching bags for bad handwriting."
"When writing you should try to imagine three lines going along the page, the top and bottom lines determine the height, and the center line determines the middle or shoulder - some school books include all three lines to help train and guide your writing. The teacher's writing in this image is uneven and each character has different proportions. This is typical of children's handwriting. The only reason I'm being critical of it is because this person is teaching others how to write and spell."
My condolences to your eyeballs for having to witness such terribleness üôÉ
It may not be so bad if it wasn't a person who's teaching others how to write and spell.

You don't want to be using slower methods though. That's how you run out of time halfway through.
"True, though there are many reasons why an answer may be deemed incorrect. Most of math tests are about *how* you get to the result. The number that comes out matters very little, if 90% of the method is correct and a tiny mistake gives you a different number.

Depending on the question, the teacher may very well be justified in marking OP as wrong despite his final result being correct."

"I once pulled up behind a cyclist sitting on their bike, on the phone in the middle of the car park (like the lady in OP). I'm a cyclist, and they weren't doing anything too bad, so I didn't want to be rude or anything, but I pulled up behind them and just assumed they would hear my car and get out of the way. They didn't. I rolled down the window and yelled out ""hey, excuse me, hey, please, you're in the middle of the road, excuse me, please move"". They couldn't hear me. I beeped the horn and they shit themselves and dropped their phone and glared at me. Honestly I felt kinda bad but... what was I supposed to do? Get out the car, walk up to them, tap them on the shoulder and ask them to move?"

I work in a grocery store, and oh my fucking GOD people are so unaware of what's going on around them, I feel like I'm surrounded by just a fuckton of Mr. Magoos. How did all these grown ass adults even make it here alive? It's a HUGE pet peeve of mine when, while shopping, someone steps away from their cart to look at the opposing shelf and end up blocking the entire aisle with their haphazardly parked shopping cart and then their body so *conveniently* perfectly in. the. way.  Like, damn, you're not the only fucking person in this fucking store???? Scoot over, bitch, damn! 

I bet you this lady didn't even notice the OP driving behind her, and I HATE IT"
"This pisses me off to no end.  There is no way that you don‚Äôt know that IM RIGHT BEHIND YOU IN A TRUCK!!!!  My wife doesn‚Äôt get bothered too much by it, which I don‚Äôt understand.  Just GTF over and walk where you‚Äôre supposed to.  Bah!!"
I'm a cart pusher at Walmart. These and the people that stop in the middle of the lane to wait on a parking spot are by far some of the scummiest people on Earth.

"Almost as bad as the people who walk on the left of hallways, boardwalks etc."
I hate shopping in the suburbs because of this. People are either unaware our do not care about anyone else.
"These are the same kind of people that stop in the middle of the aisle with their carts and refuse to move while they look at the ingredients of a product. Bitch you‚Äôre gonna get it anyway, stop acting like you care."
For everyone talking about feeling bad or people making you feel bad when you honk the horn I just wanna let you know that **thats literally what horns are for**
She drives 54 mph in the fast lane.
So you have chosen death
"This isn‚Äôt even mildly infuriating, it‚Äôs murder inducing."
Amen.  This also applies to when you‚Äôre IN the store as well.  Some people are oblivious when it comes to common courtesies.
I bet she's never let someone merge in her life
"One of the perfect instances to honk

Edit: you gotta get real close though"

"Look lady, you look like you value your ass MUCH more than I value my 03 Civic I bought specifically to beat the sit out of!"

That‚Äôs almost as annoying as that person who crosses the longest way possible diagonally while looking you dead in the eyes.
I've noticed people around 45+ never fuckin look when crossing the parking lot areas. Wtf is up with that?
Knowing I‚Äôm not alone about this gives me comfort. Why the fuck do people do this?

That‚Äôs Edith. She‚Äôs a bad bitch and she walks wherever the FUCK she wants
Most people that do this don't even realize it!
This is definitely annoying but sometimes I try walk closer to the middle because its dangerous to be directly behind cars that are reversing.
Honk the shit out from her
"Depress clutch, 

Rev engine."
Honk.
"This is the type of person who stops in the middle of a walkway with people all around her, oblivious to everyone else.

How can people be so unaware of themselves?"
"One time i was coming back from Walmart (what a big surprise) with my family and we were in the parking lot and this same situation happened to is. We all realized we were blocking someone but I was the only one who went to a side while everyone else stayed where they were (still in the way). I told them to get out of the way for the driver, but they didnt listen for some reason. I looked at the driver and gave him a look to show him that I was sorry but there was nothing I could do about it."
Lay the horn bro
"Ugh, I'm so glad for the people in this sub.  I get so annoyed when people do things like this when I go shopping, and my mom doesn't mind it and thinks I have anger issues.

I probably do, but when people do this shit, can you blame me?"
Everytime someone does this as soon as I get in front of them I rev my straight piped car and they get so angry I love it.
"Naw, just yesterday I had some bitch (this is being put mildly) open her car door all the way right after I pulled in and left it open as she loaded into the trunk. I then asked her politely to close her door and, after ignoring me, I closed it for her. She then went into a shit fit about me touching her car and how I should have just asked her to do it."
a lady did this to me and had the audacity to give me a disgusted look as if i were checking her out the entire time
"100% agree.

Also, as a pedestrian, it's so annoying when cars stop in a street to give you right of way, but like four cars could turn before I get across. Just go, fucks sake. I legit turn around and walk the other way and they still act all confused and sit in the street. Go!"
"Honk and say ""excuse YOU!"" Fuck people like that,and dont be afraid to lay into them."
Just as bad as people blocking the whole aisle in a store because they thought it was the perfect spot to catchup on their whole life story.
"Hahaha, this happened to me last weekend.  I edged my car past her at about 1 MPH but she shouted at me, ""You could have run me over, you know that?""

I shouted back, ""I still can!"""
You should be allowed to run them down.
"She knows you are behind her, she believes this is the only control she obtains within her existence. Just drive slow and feel bad for this human."
"Just honk at her. If she doesn't move outta the way, get your car so close to her that she's forced to pick up the pace, but don't run her over."
"I agree, but understand that walking close to the line of cars expose you to someone who is suddenly backing away. You have to pay a close attention to every car (some might be hidden behind bigger ones), and even then it's not super safe. So I think you can sacrifice 20 seconds to enhance the safety of people who prefer to see more clearly the cars backing out."
She went to the Prometheus school of running away from things.

"By the looks of her haircut, I bet she had just spoken to the manager"
The proper position for an EZ pass is behind your rear-view mirror for best reception by the scanner and least visual obstruction.
Had something like this happen once. Did avery brief honk and she turned around and started bitching at me. I laid on the horn and just drowned her out. Briefly touched the gas then brake and it scared the FUCK out of her and she almost fell after backing up into her cart. Started honking again until she left.
First rule of boating Spongebob?  FLOOR IT!
Honk your horn.

I fucking hate it when people do this! ACH!!!
Try doing this while driving a car that makes virtually no noise. It happens way more often
10 points if you can hit her without hitting the cart.
"I was in a extremely busy Costco parking lot when two people decided it would be okay to walk in the middle of the aisle. There was no where I could turn so I honked at them. Was it an asshole move? Probably, but it was satisfying to see their reaction and they quickly moved out of my way."
You‚Äôre at Walmart...that behavior is a given.
The worst is when you drive a hybrid so your engine is silent and they can‚Äôt hear you right behind them.
You have a horn. Use it
"This is when you put your car in neutral and floor it.

Don't forget to make 100% sure it's in neutral."
Why does this photo look like it‚Äôs from 1983?

A quick double honk; if she doesn‚Äôt move lay in the horn
"Equally as bad are the people in cars that won‚Äôt pass you when you‚Äôre walking inches from parked cars and they have the entire lane to drive... what‚Äôs your game here, Karen?"
You're in a parking lot. Pedestrians have the right of way.
\*Honks loudly\*
I get up at 3 in the morning to get to work early. I get a nice front spot at work all the time. I might be there an hour earlier but I'm no the only one. When everyone leave work. All employee rush out like cattle some even run cause the parking lot is a clustter fuck that will add 30 minutes on your drive time during rush hour. So since I have a nice front spot most of the time I'm out of the parking lot in 5 minutes. The problem is when people do this. This exact same thing and you driving right behind them. WTF Karen get your ass out the way i wanna get home in a decent hour. I don't want to be stuckin traffic for an hour. Not only that but she park next to the exit so she can skip the line of cars that is right behind me. Fuck people that do this!
"I swear, people at the grocery store are among the most stupid human beings."
Honk. And scream at them out your window. It‚Äôs what I do every time.
Little high strung there bud
"Or people who stop and stand right in the entryway with their cart as other people try to enter/exit. 

They just live in their own little world don‚Äôt they?"
I take these 5 mph moments to contemplate my existence.
If someone does this we should have every right to run them over
Wtf this is a repost check my profile
"Just roll your window down and say, ‚ÄúHey that‚Äôs a reeeeaaaaal nice ass you got there‚Äù. They move out the way after that for me."
Oh I just lay on the horn.

She's gripping that cart weird.
"After a week long trip to New England, I'm happy to bring the horn back to my area. Honk honk, motherfucks"
It's a Karen
As someone who shops as a job. People do this and other things so often. Like stop all of a sudden. In the middle of an isle. Or block an entire isle. In Costco. This tales talent. Just be aware of others.
Boomer traits
I put the car in park and rev the engine
[this](https://youtu.be/q8VcL3h1Dkg?t=31) will make you feel better or worse
"I lightly rev my engine at these people so they know im there, if they ignore that, then they get the horn."
"Follow her, as close as you can and just HOLD DOWN THAT FUCKING HORN."
"Thats why I like have an exhuast system on my car, if I rev to like 1.5k its makes enough noise to let them know Im there, without being a complete asshole or laying on the horn"
#HONK
"They know exactly what they're doing and they don't give a fuck.

&#x200B;

Is this the Arkansas walmart?"
Closely followed by same lady waiting in her car for you to load your groceries and pull out to take your parking spot when there is another wide open spot 10 feet further down
It's a Karen so I'd bet money she knew what she was doing and took joy in it.
"It should be legal to move them to one side or the other using the front of your car, like a slow pit maneuver."
"Oh, I honk. It may not make them move and theyll get all pissy, but I will not let my frustration at these morons actions go unheard. Maybe theyll think twice about it next time, maybe not, but at least I'm trying to let them know they're acting like selfish assholes."
"Sometimes I day dream about being so petty that I find a new parking spot, then do the same thing to her as she's trying to leave."
Also people who stop right inside the doorway of a shop or restaurant. GTFO of our way!
Speak for yourself. I could look at that ass all day.
It‚Äôs safest to walk in the middle so cars can see you when backing up.
This is what train horns are for
"This isn‚Äôt mildly infuriating, this is VERY infuriating."
"ill admit the middle of the road is the best place to walk, but I do move aside when cars come."
r/fuckthesepeople
The entitlement of the boomer generation is astonishing...
Absolutely zero self awareness
They do this shit in the grocery aisles too.
You got to nose in next to them and force your way around
That‚Äôs how you should walk through a parking lot lest you get hit by someone backing up who doesn‚Äôt see you
I‚Äôm guessing she wanted to right part of it she doesn‚Äôt want the cars on the right . Just people patience . It‚Äôs older lady
#oblivious
That‚Äôs what powerful air horns are for
That's when I honk and start waving out my window in a different direction like I honked at someone I know somewhere else.
This why games like GTA are so cathartic. It‚Äôs release from bullshit.

These are the worst breed
"I think 30% of the population has zero awareness of others. Something in their brain does not work. These are the people that talk at the front of a long line after being served and don‚Äôt get the fuck out of the way. They are the people who keep a conversation going for way too long and don‚Äôt sense the person they are talking to wants to get the fuck away from them. They are also the people that stand in the fucking way no matter the situation. And when people yell at them, they have no fucking clue what they are doing wrong."
"Doesn't matter which lane she chooses, that ass is taking up both."
"Isn't standard protocol to lay on your horn and follow closely to make sure that she's safe until she's safely made it to her car? I mean, who would hit her if you're protecting her with your vehicle and making sure that people can hear she needs to be protected?"
Looks like an average Pennsylvania parking lot. I see this all the time. Quick engine rev usually lets them know you're there.
I saw the keystone and then everything made sense. Gotta love rural PA. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Good ol' PA
Who cares. Honk.
PA EZ-pass makes complete sense. This is my life too.
"I really hate that shit.  I run into at work frequently with people walking 3 abreast at around half a mph....and I walk really fast.  In my dreams I drop my shoulder like they are bowling pins and just barrel through, such a great dream."
"It's her world, you are just living in it!"
I fucking hateeeeee this.
This or people who stop right inside the door
They do it in the aisles of the store so why would the parking lot be any different?
"On the other hand, people like this keep all the dipshit drivers who don't seem to understand they're in a parking lot driving at a reasonable speed. Unsung hero?"
Karens gonna Karen.
White privilege is completely disregarding that other people exist or might have shit they need to get done.
Damn karen
A wild Karen appears. Do you want to Fight or Run?
Don't forget coming to a complete stop and holding the stare for 30s minimum
Just follow them to their car. Park quickly. Grab a cart and as soon as they sit in their car push the cart behind them and leave it there so they have to get out and move it before they can back up.
I mean what else am i doing in my car
I honked and the person attempted to ram my car with the shopping car lmao
"If they refuse to move don't honk long or quickly. Do reasonably short, consistent, and slow honks over and over. This resets your brains ability to tune something out and basically makes it impossible to truly ignore."
"When they act indignant, just lay into the horn. Double down and these bitchy Beckys fold."
At this range you‚Äôre better off just rolling down the window and shouting ‚ÄúExcuse me!‚Äù
This is when a train horn comes in handy
Honk anyways lmao
"And then you lean your head out your window and politely yell ""hey could you please move aside?"" and then it's likely they will because people are afraid of confrontation."
Yes but will they move?
"And I'm still going to keep my hand there, honking until they are away. I don't care honestly, people think they are entitled. But truth is, everyone hates being honked at :p"
I always honk if a pedestrian is in the middle of the road.
"If refuses to move, follow her to her car, block her in, then pretend to   be on the phone snd refuse to move.  Give her the "" just a minute"" finger, smile, snd pretend to keep talking."
Fucking North America has too many entitled bitch Karens.
I prefer to rev the engine a bit. Scares them out of the way before they give you the look.
No need to feel bad. If I'm on my bike I assume everyone is trying to kill me so I'd feel pretty foolish stopping somewhere that impedes traffic. Hopefully this person learns to be a little more aware after that encounter.
"> they weren't doing anything too bad

They were blocking traffic."
"My city requires cyclists be given 3 feet space to share the lane, it is beyond frustrating when a cyclist has their head so far up their ass they don't hug the right side of the lane, not leaving enough space for a vehicle to pass them without crossing the center line... if the vehicle is leaving the requisite 3 feet of space.

I've reminded myself that if they don't leave enough space, I'd be increasing my risk of getting rear ended if I stay behind them crawling under half the speed limit. I just get as close to the center line without going over and proceed past them at speed. I cannot do any more to concern myself with the safety of people who ignore the safety of everyone behind them."
"This cyclist is doing exactly what I experience from drivers probably five times a day in San Francisco - their car parked in the bike lane, waiting for their takeout or whatever, oblivious to the fact they are blocking a lane of oncoming traffic. If I say anything, I‚Äôm a lawless cunt that should mind my own business. 

Maybe he was protesting."
">I once pulled up behind a cyclist sitting on their bike, on the phone in the middle of the car park

This was not a cyclist, it was a douche on a bike. People that are this unaware of their environment are a danger to themselves. I ride bike in the city everyday and I am always aware of my environment on all sides, I would never stop anywhere other than the grass to check my phone."

Nah dude she's an older woman. You ever see an old lady with long hair past her shoulders? Look around you. Think about it. You haven't. It basically doesn't exist I think.
"Ah, I see, a Karen in its natural habitat"
"It doesn't say ""let me speak to your manager"" but it does say ""I'm completely oblivious to everything around me at all times."" The type that stands in the middle of walking traffic, or leaves her cart in high traffic areas. Not malicious, just aloof all the time."
I just realized that Asian moms also have that hairstyle. Truly the Karen transcends culture.
This here is part of the reason Millenials shouldn‚Äôt take crap from Boomers.
That they're 60 and lack spatial awareness?
"That ass, too."
"Oops, foot slipped off the clutch for a sec there."
"Did that to a gaggle of teenagers once. Made them jump out of the way. 10/10 very satisfying, would do it again."
"Yeah, pressing the clutch and reving the engine a bit while rolling towards people usually makes them jump pretty fast."
"I drive a tiny 4-cylinder car, I'd be lucky if they heard it. :("
"I do the engine rev as well. It‚Äôs a manual transmission so it‚Äôs easy to do a quick rev. I feel like it‚Äôs a good mix of passive/aggressive behavior to let the person know I‚Äôm right behind them. Normally it works pretty well, but the other day some lady ran for her life when I did it like she thought I was going to run her down. Complete overreaction, maybe she was playing her own game with me. And so it continues."
Such an alpha move. Works every time.
Put it in neutral first.
"Yeah, then entitled Karen flips you off. It's a weird, ""I'm a pedestrian, I have a right to walk here so I am"" attitude. Also, Karen's self-image is one of kindness and caring for all people and animals."
Maybe she's just oblivious?
The one benefit of a slightly loud car is that I can kind of rev it a little bit which doesn't seem to piss anyone off
Karen is not a name. Karen is a rank you achieve. This is why you‚Äôve never met a baby named Karen.
"I used to work grocery and can verify. Mr and Ms Magoos as far as the eye could see. Blocking aisles was an art form, to these people. 

* Stopping at a display so no one can get past and reading the entire ingredient list (while googling the ones they didn't know).
* Meeting a person they know coming in the opposite direction and placing their carts side by side so that they can have a nice chat about every banal detail of their lives that happened since the last time they did this.
* Starting to turn around, then pausing halfway to reconsider, then staring at the hanging aisle sign for a bit, then straining to see the aisle sign on either side, then getting frustrated, then leaving the cart halfway turned and walking over to a worker to ask them where some super specific brand of something is, but specifically stating that they already looked on the aisle that everything like it is.
* Walking down the middle of the aisle and acting like it is a burden to have to get within 6 inches of the shelf to let someone else pass. Of course, they only let oncoming people pass. If you're behind them? Tough luck. 

But woe be to the poor clerk who has a U Float in front of that cereal section, because they are refilling something. You might as well just be actual goddamn Hitler for making them have to ask you to hand them those fucking corn flakes."
"Same here. I have an older diesel truck that is louder than your average vehicle in a parking lot and yet I still seem to creep up on people doing this. 

I just don't get obliviousness. When I'm in public I'm on constant alert and paying attention to where myself and other people are."
"I'm not bothered by the obstacle itself. I don't expect a 100%  efficiency in traffic.

I'm going absolutely ballistic because of the arrogance and their self importance. Fuck em to hell. That kind of narcissism should give you the chair or the injection. Garbage lumps of flesh."
Same way your wife will leave her shopping cart in the middle of the aisle and not consider anyone else and also not get upset about others doing it: they are fucking psycho
I don't get the parking spot waiters unless it's like pouring rain or something. You're going to walk like a mile inside the Walmart. Who cares if you have to take an extra 10 steps in the lot.
"Someone tried to wait for a parking space I was using at the Mall of America. (On a Saturday at 10:00 a.m.) We were putting our purchases in the trunk because our arms were getting tired. I didn't realize the guy was waiting for our space until we started walking back towards the entrance. He put his minivan in park and stomped after us screaming bloody murder. Luckily, we were near one of the patrolling security guards who called for backup and had the parking space waiter escorted from the premises."
Waiting for a spot and blocking everything even though there's a ton of open spots like 5 down.  Lazy assholes
this might be a walmart judging by the blue cart thing. i'm just not sure what you expect out of people who go to walmart anymore.
Motherfuckers using their ‚Äúpark anywhere lights‚Äù in the fire lane too.  Oh I‚Äôm just going in real quick!  Yeah you and the rest of us.
"""I'm not in any hurry, so there's no reason why you should be either."""
I don't get waiting for a spot when there's an open one 10-15 spots down.  Like dude...most of y'all fat asses could do good with a little extra walking.
"They also might be those that leave their carts in the lot instead of returning them. As a former cart pusher, I feel you."
"If I get in my car to leave a spot and see someone waiting for me, I put it back in park, hop on my phone and wait until they leave.  I think the longest was like 8 minutes before she gave me the rudest look ever and sped off to find another spot. 

I wasn't even in one of the closest spots either.  And there were PLENTY of other spots open just a little bit down the lane."
"the people who get in your way when you're pushing 300 pounds of rolly steel like it won't run them over

""I'm the customer I can walk wherever I want"""
"If someone follows me to my car and is waiting for me to leave, I take my sweet ass time until they give up and leave. I hate that shit."
"Whenever I‚Äôm shopping and I‚Äôm in an aisle with my cart and I see someone coming my direction, my first instinct is to scoot over so we both have space to pass each other.

But I never get that same courtesy in return no matter where I am. It makes me wonder am I the odd one for caring about not impeding on other people‚Äôs paths in public spaces?! 

It‚Äôs just OVERWHELMING the number of people who are oblivious to their surroundings or simply just don‚Äôt care and expect YOU to move."
Boomer walls.  I just push their shit out of the way now.
The groups that walk side by side across a sidewalk! I‚Äôve learned to walk with a purpose because just once I stepped off onto the curb and decided never again
"You must have been at Costco with us this afternoon. 

Two carts side by side,  Two men, just a‚Äôchattin.  Everyone else squeezing by.  

They got crop dusted tho, so there‚Äôs that."
"I grew up in Seattle, where everyone is polite. Living in Florida has forced me to develop a much more ‚Äúrip the steering wheel off and throw it out the window while chugging a bottle of bourbon‚Äù approach to getting my shopping cart past another grocery store patron‚Äôs. I think I‚Äôll still be able to go back to being polite if I ever get to move back to a place that allows it, but still..."
"I don't think that ""mildly"" adverb is accurate here. Everything else, spot on."

I did that before and the person actually walked slower lol
"I wish cars had a polite horn, that was less of a horn and more of a 'meep', just to nicely get someone's attention while showing no aggression."
"It‚Äôs because she knows OP hates to see her go, but loves to watch her leave."
Like a bedbug?
Thanks for saving me the necessity of looking it up. I was pretty sure I had seen this whole thing before
People that walk the wrong way at the mall really get on my nerves but I think that‚Äôs just me?
People who walk abreast each other and take up the entire sidewalk/bike path make me reconsider not being a serial killer
"Steals an item from your basket cause it‚Äôs the last one in the store, stand on the left side of the escalator, 7 deep across the side walk, leave trash on table at a fast food place for min wage worker to get, berate the cashier when 2 of the 37 coupons don‚Äôt work because it‚Äôs expired and not even the correct product, don‚Äôt tip/give gum to the bellhop who just brought up your 6 50lb luggages so that your 10 deep family can stay in a 4 person capacity room, slows down to 5 mph to make a turn, speeds through a 4 way, takes 6 parking spaces, leaves the cart to block 2 spaces"
Or the people who park their cart against the opposite side of the aisle while shopping on the one side. Now they‚Äôre blocking the whole thing. Why do you do this?!?!
o boi do i got something for you /r/rage /r/iamatotalpieceofshit enjoy hating earth after browsing those lmao
this makes me want to get one of those train horns on my car
They are ready.. like seriously they have accepted death and welcome his loving embrace.
"No consideration for other people, combine that with total lack of situational awareness."
I feel like once people enter a grocery store parking lot every bit of spatial awareness just gets put on pause in that general area.
I like to throw in a thumbs down while our eyes are locked to really give my displeasure an outlet.
Lay on the horn the whole time as you inch closer
"They pull that game, I just follow them to where their car is and park there not allowing them to leave for equally long.  Oh man the visible panic that sets in is priceless."
Stare in a different direction
"Then you idle right behind them so they can‚Äôt get out.

Take 5 min of my time, I‚Äôm taking it back."
HONK AGAIN
The entire time they stare at you just lay on the horn. Assert your dominance.
Hold down the horn if you want to be hard.
Would you legally be in the wrong if you kept the slow pace they were walking and they get hit because they stopped in the middle of traffic?
"When I honk, I hold the horn until the honkee corrects their behavior."
Figure out which way they are driving out and walk slowly in front of them the whole way.
This is a level of petty that I admire.
Lol I‚Äôve done this to people who put their groceries away and then just push the cart into the road. Assholes
Don't kill babies while driving. It's dangerous.
Looking for babies to kill?

"Just continually inch forward while on the horn too. No matter how passive aggressive tough someone is, they‚Äôll move out the way of a car"
This is a barb.  (Pronounces beaeaearb). These bitches will leave the cart where it is and confront you about being rude to them.  When you counter aggress they double down and start yelling like they‚Äôre being prison raped.
">Excuse me GET THE FUCK OUT OF MY WAY!

FTFY"
"I've had airhorns in the past. I find that while they get people's attention they also have a way of making them just outright freeze in place. Sometimes you need a short beep to get them to move along or to the side. Stopping dead defeats that. I then added a switch in the cab to be able to change from a normal car horn to ""_GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE WAY_"" mode. In the above case I'd use the car horn."
"I don't know where you live, but here they're illegal on most vehicles without air brakes."
*honk honk*
Slower walking speed.
"My country has a crap ton of biking in major cities, and it‚Äôs almost like tourists specifically try and hit us"
Holding up traffic for a minute in a carpark isn't a huge deal really. There's normally other cars and people walking and stuff so it wasn't like I expected to make it out in a hurry.
Just cross the line when overtaking a cyclist.
"If it was a single lane road, then fair enough they should've left slightly more space, but for a multi-lane road it's safer for the cyclists to take up the entire lane for their own safety or cars will just attempt to squeeze past them in the same lane, even with laws that requires you to leave x amount of space, not everyone follows it all the time so it's generally safer to take the lane and force cars to switch lanes to overtake."
"Jesus, have sone empathy and understanding of the other point of view here. You will give 3 feet if the bicyclist is hugging the side of the road. Will everyone? I can tell you majority do not and would assume if you were to set up most people they couldn't tell you how far three feet is from inside their car. This is why it is advised to own your lane in most places. If you high the right, people will pass much closer thinking they have space. It is incredibly dangerous. 

That being said, I think it says a lot when you are comparing a human life to getting rear ended as an equivalency. I doubt there is much room for reasoning here."
The reason people on bikes take up the lane is because if they hug the right assholes will pass them at 50mph inches away. If you have to move over to pass it forces you to actually asses the situation and find a safe point to pass the cyclist
"You're failing to consider that a cyclist can take as much space as necessary for their own safety. Hugging a white line or riding next to parked cars that may door you is not safe riding. 

You're in a huge metal container, you're already safe. Pass when you can with enough room. 

The road is for everyone, not just cars"
"I think a lot of people mistakenly believe that bicyclists are supposed to ""hug the right"".

For instance, here in California, the law does say that bicyclists should operate as far right as practicable, but there is a whole list of exceptions, and it is extremely rare to find a   stretch of roadway where one of the exceptions does not apply.

Unless it's a very wide road lane with no debris, sidestreets, parked cars, driveways, or sidestreets, cyclists should be operating close to the middle of the road, where they're going to be visible, not right-hooked, not doored, and not dodging road debris. When a car is following, cyclists should pull to the right where they believe it is safe for someone to pass.

Some motorists really need to learn the law more closely and spend some time on a bike. It will give you a better idea just how badly a lot of our infrastructure is designed and how many dangerous psychos there are operating heavy machinery."
"Where I live, it's the law to change lanes when passing cyclists. When I bike, I sometimes take the center of the lane to avoid being killed by cars passing me too close, or to avoid being hit by someone opening the door on their parked car."
Karen the organic speed bump.  How environmentally considerate!
boomer tomb-er
Shit. That was an unexpected laugh
"She‚Äôs on her way home to make Spa-Peggy and meatballs, and some of her famous frito chili pie"
A little known fact is that all Karen‚Äôs are daughters of Peggy‚Äôs.
Eskoocha may?
What the fuck I know a Peggy with hair like that
"Even The Office comments on this - when Angela cuts Dwight's aunt's hair, she chastises her for having ""hair far too long for her age"" - as your hair grays, it gets real dry, and then you have a head of long, scraggly dry hair."
"My Grandma and her sister both have hair down to their butts and they both refuse to cut it, BUT for as long as I can remember, they've both worn short, brown, curly wigs (the classic, elderly woman hairstyle) over the top of their natural hair every. single. day. which I absolutely do not understand, but w/e, you do you, Booboo. 

When I was very young, I had never seen them without the wigs, and thought it was their real hair because idk, why wouldn't I. We had moved out of state when I was around 4, but moved back when I was about 5 and ended up staying with my Grandma and her sister for a bit while my mom looked for a place to live. I cannot TELL you the complete and utter horror and shock I experienced when I saw them without their wigs for the first time as they were doing their nightly routine. 

Looking back, I always imagine them looking very similar to Grandma Death in Donnie Darko, but I think that is an exaggerated memory from my 5 year old perspective. Still, it fucking ROCKED my tiny world. 

To this day, I do not understand why they'd go through all the trouble of stuffing all their hair into those short, dusty wigs on the DAILY, but I've just chalked it up to be one of the world's great mysteries in the same vein as Atlantis or the great pyramids. Bless their geriatric hearts."
We got plenty of older Cajun women that do.
"That‚Äôs no Karen.

"This actually happens to me once when I was learning to drive stick, luckily no one was in front of me and I was just showing off to some friends."
"my car sounds like a loud, whiny lawn mower lmao and it‚Äôs an i4 engine :/"
"One time I followed a Karen like this back to her car, parked and grabbed a cart, then returned the favor in spades walking as slow as I could in front of her while she was trying to leave. Even coming to a complete stop a couple times to pretend like I was digging around my pockets looking for something. It was magical.

Edit: english hard"
"Until she gets behind the wheel. Then it‚Äôs ‚Äúfuck all y‚Äôall, bingo‚Äôs not gonna play itself!‚Äù"
"Never really understood that mentality. I, as a person on feet, am way more agile and able to move directions 100% quicker than someone in a car. Plus a car has about 2000 pounds on me and usually about 300 more horsepower so I, as the pedestrian, always try to stay out of a cars way.

In the fight of car hitting person. Car has won 200% of the time"
That‚Äôs when you just keep laying on the horn. Then roll your window down as she moves out of the way and blast her with that drink still sitting in the cup holder from Yesterday that you meant to throw out.

*I start looking at aisle contents*

""Is it that one?""

""Which?""

""The one that fucking says tomato paste!"" in the rudest tone.

I look up and the aisle we are standing in front of has, in it's list of contents, clearly and largely printed, ""TOMATO PASTE.""

I could barely contain my fury. ""Yeah, that's probably it isn't it?!"" just short of cussing that old shit out."
"I call them NPC‚Äôs in my life journey. Not a programming glitch, just an annoyance the developer is grinning about daily. Maybe they are setting up new scenes outside so the NPC Magooability gets temporarily cranked."
"You won‚Äôt creep up on people unless they‚Äôre hard of hearing. They‚Äôre probably too lazy to care about others in that small amount of time. 


This mindset is terrible."
bold of you to assume they're going to walk
"Agreed.  I have never understood this.  When I go to a store with a big lot, I just pick a spot and park, I'm going ot be walking in that store anyway.  Not sure why 20 steps are more valuable than 5 minutes for some people."
That's just it. Those 10 extra steps are hell for them. Exercise is the enemy.
The only time I‚Äôve ever become a parking spot waiter is when there‚Äôs literally no where to park. Those crazy Christmas shopping days come to mind where even the spots way way in the back are filled.
It‚Äôs completely fine to wait for a spot. It‚Äôs not fine to wait in the middle of the lane and block traffic.
Same with the idiots that can't walk 10 feet to put the carts back and instead leave them in a spot so no one can park there or they roll into someone's car and scratch it. I guess they're just so exhausted from walking in the store they couldn't possibly walk any further.
I always willfully park far away because I know there are always parking spaces available.
That's always been my thinking with these assholes that aren't handicapped that park in the handicap spots. They can't be bothered to walk an extra 50 feet from a regular spot but no big deal to walk around Wal Mart for an hour.
I usually park far away wheres no cars next me and just walk but if I see a spot I sometimes park close.
"Everyone, even I, need(s) to remember that most of the times someone makes you angry, it's just lack of awareness, not malicious intent."
"Because apparently ""if it's not the closest, it's not the best.""... I think it stems from the toxic driving attitudes that grow from competitive driving, such as ""I have to be the first on the highway"", ""If someone passes me, they think they're better!"", ""Where I'm going and what I'm doing is more important than anyone else"", and other such fun things."
"I seriously avoid Walmart like a plague. Target is the way to go for sure. There's only one Walmart I go to if I need to, it's only about 10 years old and far away from scummy areas. I've seriously been walking into that Walmart and wind blew and I got a waft of BO right up my nose."
"""Oh I see you coming my direction with a big line of carts in the bright green reflective vest in this 100 degree weather. Let me just stop right in your path and hold all traffic for ten minutes so you can't do your job."""
"Conversely, the ""I'm in a hurry""/""I'm late, so you should be too!""

It's all selfish, haha."
"Kind of unrelated to parking but a few weeks ago I came in and there was multiple corrals full of carts AND had carts literally just thrown on top of the ones that were already in there. It takes 10x more effort to pick on of those up and put it on top of another than to either take it back up to the store or another corral. I just don't get it.

I haven't even been a cart pusher that long but I have quite a few interesting stories."
"> It makes me wonder am I the odd one for caring about not impeding on other people‚Äôs paths in public spaces?!

There are dozens of us! Dozens!"
It doesn't help that every goddamn store now clutters the aisles with displays of random crap that block carts and the shelves behind them. It's like being in an obstacle course
I get severe anxiety if I think I'm impeding someone. And will go out of my way to open up room. My wife on the other hand while courteous is pretty oblivious to others until they are right next to us so I end up moving the cart before they get there. Shopping with her stresses me out.
Common courtesy is not so common
"Another thing I do is generally stay on the right side, yield to oncoming traffic, etc... the same as driving.  I know there aren't laws on how to navigate with a shopping cart, but it is generally helpful to have certain unspoken rules so we aren't slowing each other down.  Unfortunately, many people don't do this."
"Some of the NYC transplants I know have told me that the real ""if you can make it there, you can make it anywhere"" place is Florida.  As a South Florida native I was shocked at how nice everyone in NYC was when I first visited."
"It looks like a blue keystone though, mine is green"
Hi friend!

That's when you get out of the car and fuck them.
I'm sure there's a patent out there for this already. Why has no manufacturer made this?
I've heard of smug bed bugs but not snooty.
I do this. It works best on young people. They hate being rated.
I do a slow clap
I do a thumbs up with a huge smile. It confuses the hell outta people
I think this is the best response to this situation. Will use. Will downvote all middle aisle walkers.
You do this while frowning and slowly shaking your head as well...  Really gets the idea across.
That would work if my horn wasn‚Äôt [this](https://youtu.be/zAKksqKR3pI)
 The horn is good but nothing like some squealing tires to give a temporary fear of mortality.
Because they think they're about to be shot...
I did that to someone whoa stole my spot and shruggeg. We happened to be leaving the same time and i blocked her in. She didnt notice. Backed up without looking and hit my door.
Yes. You would likely be arrested
"Oh my god. That's such a lie. If anything, I'm a way more careful driver when I'm killing babies. And it's only like 3 or 4 at a time. It's not like a drive while killing 12 babies, anyway. Even if I did, that's still not as dangerous as texting and driving."
"Pull off to the side of the road before killing a baby. Keep yourself and others safe. 

The more you know."
you'd think so but then there's stuff like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/55yl08/collision_between_a_chinese_car_and_a_german_bike/) or [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/adtjd5/when_nokia_makes_bicycles/)  pretty sure shopping carts are made out of carbon steal the way they feel when they ram your achilles
"What if they think ""Ha, they'll never actually hit me"""
"Frig off, Barb."
If they leave the cart in my way and walk away from it then the cart is getting bumped out of the way as I drive freely down the lane without a potential person to hit with my car.
"Yeah I'm laughing at all the people saying to escalate the situation.

Bitch she will scream, call the cops on you, she'll march back into the store and demand security camera footage from the 16 year old cashier, she will take pictures of your car, yelling how she's gonna sue you for threatening her life and you'll never drive again üòÇ.

Don't test an entitled old lady with too much free time on her hands. 

I mean, by all means escalate the situation...folks just need to be prepared for the potential consequences versus confident she'll immediately roll over and you'll get to drive home with your justice boner."
Yeah an air horn is mostly just a lesson in being aware of what's around you. I don't have one but I do have an old fire truck siren that might be more effective.
Or stand there gawking at you with their mouths wide open while catching gnats.
More horn?
Talking about bikes and whining about tourists. You must be from Amsterdam. Never been to a place where the people are so cunty to tourists and I lived in Barcelona for a year!
"In the U.S. and i'm sorely tempted, especially since bikers seem to think the rules of the road don't apply to them. I have never once seen one stop at a stop sign, and they rarely use hand signals. they cut across in front of drivers like they're fishing for a funeral or an insurance payout"
The person was talking on the phone ignoring everything in the middle of the road. You have no way of knowing how long they will sit there.
Yeah where I live it's written into the law that cyclists can take the entire lane if they require.
And a nice Brown Betty for dessert.
Of course you do. That's what Peggys look like
"Damn it, bobby"
"Yep yep.  Trying to condition and care for dry old hair when you're likely past menopause, combined with everything being way harder than it used to be, makes having long hair a very low priority for older women."
"At first I thought you meant they just put the wig on their heads with their hair down, like the most glorious mullet ever."
"Saw pic, immediately thought ""that's a Carol, in her natural habitat"""
I‚Äôm thinking that‚Äôs a Joyce.
Yeah those are much more likely names for rural PA.
That‚Äôs a Helen if I ever did see one
Yeah that‚Äôs a Walmart parking lot in the south. She‚Äôs at least in her 60s. Any of those names check out.
Definitely thought that was a Carol or Betty.
My grandma is a Betty. This is a Betty.
I‚Äôm getting a Susan vibe from this one.
Correct. AKA ‚Äòmom‚Äô.
"Well it ain‚Äôt to Jolene, that‚Äôs for sure."
No that‚Äôs for sure a Barb.
Too young for a Madge. Carol or Cheryl definitely.

"There was one time I was stocking and had a cart of nothing but olives. I was standing under the sign that said olives were on the aisle. I was in front of a shelf of olives. I had a jar of olives in my hand.

Dude rocks up to me, all pissy. ""Where do you folks hide the olives?""

I stared at him for a second, then slowly tried to hand him the jar I was holding.

He got red faced and stormed off. Without any olives."
"Well to be fair, if you're the lunchbox riding the zoomy cart around, you're probably gonna have a handicap tag anyways."
"Well unless they are camping out for a handicapped spot (which, guess what, its never that) how else do you expect them to get around? Rolling on the ground like they're on fire?"
My fucking ex  would drive around a parking lot for 15 mins looking for a spot like Jesus Christ dude we could be on our way home already just park!!
"I came here to say this too! Advantages of parking farther:

1. You don't have to fight for a space.
2. Save on gas if you're self-interested and emissions if you're not. 
3. Burn maybe 5 extra calories. 
4. Your car is less likely to get scratched.
5. You can pull out faster and easier.
6. You gain 3 arbitrary cardio points.
7. You're less likely to hit pedestrians. 
8. You can see if anyone is hiding under your car at night. (for the vulnerable)

I'm sure there's more reasons...

&#x200B;

Advantages to fighting for a close spot:

1. You... get to save 30 steps maybe? 
2. You have less to go if it's dark or scary.

Honestly, I can't think of ANY other reasons. If it's raining, bring an umbrella. Seriously, they're no big deal now with those [nifty backwards-folding ones](https://www.amazon.com/Sharpty-Inverted-Windproof-Protection-Polkadots/dp/B079576XFY/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=umbrella+backwards&qid=1563044648&s=gateway&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1)."
I wish every parking garage would be like the ones at Disney Springs. They have a light system to identify open parking spaces so people have no reason to get mad at other people who lack spatial awareness. Lol
"Unfortunately there is no Target where I live, but by golly there are 3 Walmarts here (2 superstores and 1 neighborhood market)"
"i'm not superstitious at all, don't believe in any divine beings, but walmart gives me just really bad vibes. it's just the whole atmosphere (ignoring the people even). the lighting, the way the shelves and stuff are placed, the ambient noise... its all bad. it's hard to support a company that helps employees get government assistance too."
"Yeah I always try to park closer to the building so I can bring it back inside or give it to someone else walking to the store. Europe, or at least Aldi, has the best cart system."
"How would you say you feel when this happens? I try to do what you do and hate when I'm blocking the way but my sister and her husband never seem to care and it stresses me out. I dunno if I get anxiety from that and crowds, etc but I think that anxiety might be the best way to describe it."
Same goes for common sense.

"And actually in a few states (including Arkansas, where I live) the stop sign rules are different for cyclists.

Not sure if that‚Äôs applicable where you are, but worth pointing out."

I've never been to Aldi but I occasionally find their carts in our lot. They're very nice and it looks like it takes change or something to unlock them and when you take it back you get the money back too.

"Hello, not Peter here to explain the joke

The joke implies that to stop anti-vaxxers from drowning you must remove your feet from their head (implying that you are the one drowning them). The OP got complaints for the joke being ""Offensive"" and the viewer thinks that the anti-vaxxers were the ones complaining but in a Twist the OP adds both his and her to his joke instead. finally revealing that anti-vaxxers were not the ones protesting but feminists."
The joke is that anti vaxxers are dumb therefore there is nothing in their head causing them to float in water

"This ""meme"" is tired and unfunny."
"The original joke is that anti-vaxers you are the one doing the drowning in the first place. It‚Äôs dark and not super funny. It also only mentions male pronouns. 

Then people were getting offended because the first joke is very dark and violent against a subgroup of people. OP is presumed to misunderstand why people were getting offended, thinking that they were upset because he only uses male pronouns. OP writes the apology to the feminists for not including them rather than to the anti-vaxxers for the original violent joke.

"It‚Äôs been a matter of debate for centuries. They has been used consistently as a singular pronoun since as early as the 1300s and before, and just recently a few dictionaries officially changed their definitions to include singular they.

Most romance languages do that (using male pronouns as neutral)
"Im 49. I remember the advice given changing, as people came to admit that when you use masculine pronouns, people actually have always been thinking of men, not ""maybe men, maybe women.""  So it's more about acknowledging the reality. 

Like, you would never have said, ""everyone should indicate his gender on the form, whether his gender is 'male' or 'female.'""  Cause that would sound stupid. And it always would have. Or ""my parent is here!"" ""Oh really? Who is he, your mother or your father?""

The white stripe in the middle of the trans flag represents nonbinary people.
They don't identify as the gender that most strongly correlates with their birth sex. I believe that makes non-conforming people trans.
We all are about some things.
Right?

You can't take an anti-vax joke but you're ok with making a meme about the new Zealand shooting?
"https://www.reddit.com/r/dankmemes/comments/b1icca/new_video_when/

?"
Just because you don't get it or don't find it funny doesn't mean it's not a joke
"Some jokes and humour rely on painting a situation, and then introducing a piece of information which makes the situation wholly different, and often absurd. Crude jokes, such as the one in the OP, rely on this.

The joke here isn't that drowning anti-vaxers is funny, but that the setup paints a situation where you initially think an anti-vaxer is being helped, and a new piece of tells you that he was actually being drowned.

And that's the joke explained objectively. The quality of the joke is another matter."
It's just not a funny joke
"Because alot of people dont like anti vaxxers, so that's why your trying to drown them in the first place"
"For the moment, yes. The Pew Surveys determined that both sides are equally likely to be anti-vaxxers depending on the intensity of their beliefs (hard conservatives & hard liberals are 1.5 times more likely more likely to oppose vaccination than moderates of their respective parties), but one interesting factor found is that the current federal governing officials play the biggest role in determining which party is more anti-vax. During the Obama administration, there were more anti-vax conservatives, but now that we're in the Trump administration, more liberals are opposed to vaccination. Essentially, the less you trust your current governing officials, the less likely you are to be pro-vaccination."

"In German, the way to say ‚Äúyou are‚Äù is ‚Äúdu bist.‚Äù The way to say ‚Äúthey are‚Äù is ‚Äúsie sind.‚Äù

Except ‚Äúdu bist‚Äù only works in an informal context. You‚Äôre only supposed to use ‚Äúdu‚Äù with your friends. It‚Äôs often a big deal in Germany when two people decide they‚Äôre close enough to start using ‚Äúdu.‚Äù Before then, how do you say ‚Äúyou are?‚Äù Well... uh... ‚ÄúSie sind.‚Äù Exactly the same as ‚Äúthey are,‚Äù and completely different from ‚Äúyou are.‚Äù

My point is, language is never so concrete. You can‚Äôt just point at ‚Äúthey are‚Äù and say it‚Äôs wrong just because it‚Äôs the odd one out. There are many languages, including English itself, that are full of non-conformed patterns and broken rules."

"There are plenty of ftm and mtf people who didn't have dysphoria before their transition. The way they knew they were trans is what's called gender euphoria - an extremely good feeling caused by presenting as their gender identity.

Many nonbinary people do hate their body as it is. HRT is common, AFAB enbies binding and packing is common, AMAB enbies tucking and stuffing is common. Top surgery is fairly common, especially in AFAB enbies. Bottom surgery is not common however.

I am nonbinary and AMAB (still questioning stuff but nonbinary is where I've landed for now). My single greatest source of dysphoria is being called a man, boy, whatever (I am in awful shape so I hate looking at my body anyway, I'm not sure if that would be dysphoria if I was in good shape). So dressing androgynously is really the only thing for me to do for now. Either way, I am not cis, which is the only reasonable definition of being trans."

Yeah fair enough. I don't think you should have been downvoted for that but imo 3 months isn't nowhere near being new unless you barely browse reddit

"It's not a joke, it's hateful message masquerading as such. I don't see the funny part. MAYBE somewhat in the first one, but not at all at the 2nd one. You're actively wishing harm on others. It has a potential to endanger other lives, and the very least it's spreading hate. My meme is just dark humor, I'm not wishing any harm to others. And let's be honest: It's damn dank."
Strange jokes you got there
"All right, explain how 

> Why would ANYONE want an anti vaxxer to live

is a joke, and what exactly is funny about it. Then tell me if you really believe jokes are completely unrelated to the person's opinions. And if you're saying that it's okay to hate if it's a joke, then please, try saying ""Why would ANYONE want a black person to live"" on other subreddits. Tell me how you fared afterwards. :-)"
"Idk, I just feel like the joke should be ""Take his foot off his head."" Y'know, because they're antivaxxers, they're a danger to themselves."
Still not getting it.
I'm not sure I understand. I don't get it

Can‚Äôt tell if troll or just another smooth brain."
"Not to discount what you're saying, but generally it's used when the gender is unknown or with a stranger. Like, ""what's that person doing? They're acting funny"" etc."
"Let me guess, you think Nazis shouldn‚Äôt be milkshaked?"

">It has a potential to endanger other lives

Much like what anti-waxxers do when they threaten social health, though not by hatred but sheer stupidity.

Edit: I forgot to add, I couldn't care less about their life since they clearly don't about mine. Those scientists haven't sacrificed their lives so some idiots can bring back diseases. The world is full of them and it wouldn't hurt if some disappeared"
"It's a joke because it's clearly satire(which is a kind of joke). Satire is usually 'humorous' exagerations to poke fun or criticize something seen as stupid(like being anti-vax). Just because you don't like a joke doesn't mean it's not a joke and just because you're offended doesn't mean you're right. 


But if anything your example sucks and is not a good comparison. No one can help or change being Black or of African decent, however someone can choose to be educated and realize that vaccines save many lives."
Yeah not wanting antivaxxers to live is basically the same thing as not wanting black people to live
"I said that that's the pattern in anti-vaxxers. A common factor is that they're distrustful of elected officials. That doesn't mean that all people distrustful of the government are anti-vax. Just that it's a recurring theme, & one to take into consideration."
"Hey now, Steve prefers gender neutral pronouns.

But yeah, I agree with what you're saying, lol. It's a good point, thanks for bringing it up!"
How many anti-vaxxers did you drown?
Fuck off loser. Go hang an anti-vaxxer
"Sorry but trans people who have dysphoria get gender euphoria too.

Sorry but you don't get to decide that for me.

See? I can do that too. Frustrating, isn't it?"
u/the_rainman i come to bargain
"It would be satire if he actually meant the opposite of what he's saying. Are you telling me the jokes really mean ""I like antivaxxers and want them to live""? What?

Please stop. You know what he meant, I know it, everyone knows. Reddit hates antivaxxers. This was simply a statement that people here agree with. 

> No one can help or change being Black or of African decent, however someone can choose to be educated and realize that vaccines save many lives.

So wishing people death is ok if they can change their stance? What? All right, start chanting ""death to all Muslims"" in the street. Tell me what happened later. :-)"
"No, it's not. Being an antivaxer is a choice, the choice to refuse to inform yourself about scientific evidence and to endanger other people with immunodeficiency. It's not comparable to being black. Anyway, it's pretty clear to me that this was just a dark joke."
"> Yeah not wanting antivaxxers to live is basically the same thing as not wanting black people to live

? Yes, it is. It doesn't matter whether you wish all criminals to die,  or republicans, black people, gay people. As long as you wish for the whole group to die, it's hate. It doesn't matter if you think they are damaging for the society, especially if it's as weak as with antivaxxers. 

I really can't believe you people are fighting me when I say ""I don't want them to live"" and ""They are not people"" are hateful words. 

I also still don't understand where's the joke."
How many times will you change the subject?
"I mean yeah you can have both but there is a *physical* difference in the brains of trans people. Mtfs possess females brains and ftms possess male brains. This difference manifests itself as gender dysphoria. Therefor, if one does not suffer from gender dysphoria in their body of birth, they are objectively speaking, not trans."
We will summon u/the_rainman
"Satire doesn't mean opposite, it means an exageration to poke fun at something seen as stupid. For example ""Its so cold out I want to light myself on fire!"" is a joke about wanting to be warm. They don't want to really be set in fire and they just don't want to be cold. This doesn't mean the opposite. 


I mean the joke likely means ""I don't like living around people who put people with weakened immune systems at risk because of their non belief in modern medicine."" Most people here on reddit don't hate antivaxxers as individuals, but hate the antivaxx ideas of hating people with autism, the extremely dangerous believe that they share that vaccines are harmful and their predatory tactics to try to scare people into thinking how they think.


Some jokes are hurtful or hateful statements, like ""a burn"" or ""satire,"" it's still a joke. Not all hateful statements are jokes. Shouting ""Death to all muslims!"" down the streets doesn't normally sound like satire, though it could be if they didn't actually mean it and there was more context to it like a Muslim man or woman saying this as a sarcastic joke. For an example similar to that my bf caught someone ease dropping in our conversation and to deter them from being nosy he said ""I can't stand Jews, I feel like Hitler should have not been stopped and allowed to take over the rest of Europe to expand his campaign to the fullest!"" it a joke because he is Jewish and clearly doesn't believe that at all but thinks it's funny that some people do think like that and say those things, it was to show how stupid people sound when they say stuff like that."
My comment was sarcastic...
"The joke is that we don't really want them to die, it's just we don't like them due to their life ending possibilities. Hating someone for how they were born (uncontrollable) is nothing like hating someone for thinking something really bad (controllable)"
"Brains are very plastic, especially in young people. It's entirely feasible that a young trans brain simply adapted to presenting as the wrong gender, but still feels the euphoria when finally presenting correctly, and that that adaptation is difficult, which could be why it doesn't always happen. The fact is that we simply don't know enough medically yet to make such a claim. Thus the only determination we have is their word. Many insurances already require that one live as their gender identity for a number of months before they will cover HRT or surgeries. Is that dedication not enough to show it's more than being ""trendy""? Yes, there are some people who claim to be trans just for attention, but give them enough time and they'll eventually be talking about their ""detransition story""."

"1 ship between Los Angelos and San Francisco takes a few hundred trucks off the road. What other alternatives do you have? Planes are fast but burn more fuel per ton. Rail would be good I guess, and I honestly don‚Äôt know much about the volume a train can move efficiently in terms of containers. Anyway, think of moving containers across the Pacific Ocean. Your two options are a plane and a ship. If you don‚Äôt need it next day delivery, the ship is far more efficient.

In the next few years, the International Maritime Organization will begin enforcing regulations regarding the reduction of sulfur in ‚Äúheavy fuel oil‚Äù. This should help, but it is up to flag states to enforce (individual country coast guards basically). Also regarding pollution, countries like the USA and recently China have what‚Äôs called an Emissions Control Area where burning heavy fuel oil (bunkers) is prohibited, and vessels must run on Ultra Low Sulfur Fuel Oil or Diesel Oil. 

I won‚Äôt say that ships don‚Äôt pollute a lot, because they do, but per ton it‚Äôs really the most practical and efficient way to move product across the world. 

What‚Äôs being overlooked and hard to enforce is ship‚Äôs crews ‚Äúfloat testing‚Äù old and broken equipment. I find that disgusting"
"Yeah, the pollution these things put out is not so satisfying to think about."
Not from country to country. US has been using rail more frequently to bring good more inland instead of trucks which cuts down on pollution. Also Maersk the largest shipper in the world is moving towards cleaner ships so we are moving in the right direction.

"It's tough to nail down in words. I don't think it's necessarily the colors themselves, but rather the unexpected contrasts; as in, colors grouped together you wouldn't expect, and they kind of clash, but in a deliberate way.

And then there is the perspective. Sometimes it is if you imagined the 4th wall, then took a picture of the fourth wall. Other times it's a perspective that isn't... optimal? Like taking a picture of people standing next to each other, but from behind.

Lastly, I think the one thing that is always present is a sense of orderly-ness, and hard lines. People stand straight up, in a row. Houses might not be symmetrical but they're very flush facing the camera.

I know what you mean about the emptiness... but I think it's because none of it is ""natural"" (as in, no candid shots of emotion), yet it clearly is. And so it resonates in a dissonant way.

I should be clear, I have no idea what I'm talking about. But I know that Wes Anderson look and that's just my interpretation of it."

"Thank you all for the positive feedback and support! And I‚Äôm aware of the planks, this is just the first day of progress. When I finish it will be public for download on PC and maybe bedrock, we‚Äôll see where I‚Äôm at after a week or two. Stay tuned for updates in the future!"
It looks really cool but I think you should make the edges of blocks connect. So it  doesn‚Äôt just look like it cuts off
"ive been looking for texture packs actually
also what size"
"This looks like a whole different indie game or something,  really cool!"
Really reminds me of Adventure Time for some reason
"[That texture pack is smoking hot.](https://i.imgflip.com/35llfh.jpg)

&#x200B;

Keep up the great work!

Edit: are you planning on doing your first mod after you're done with the texture pack? Then you could make the particles (like torch fire) match your design."
Do you know when it will be done
Minecraft: MS Paint Editon
"Maybe that is a drawing, and the texture pack he is making is fake"
Looks like Simpsons
I'll take ten
Keep up the good work man!
I would love to use this texture pack
"That looks amazing, do you have a link so I can use it?"
This looks amazing! Keep up the good work
This looks awesome! highly suggest getting those planks to line up though
Haha that's how Minecraft looks like on my laptop
"Try and make most blocks have a loop texture, so that when placed side by side, it looks like a longer block"
This is awesome. Please do continue.
I‚Äôll definitely have to check it out when your done. It looks really good.

This is it chief
Most upvoted post in the last hour on reddit!
I like the style...looks like ms paint but if you look closely you can see that the lines dont line up perfectly...maybe you can fix this somehow
"Dude, that looks awesome!"
What's it called and where do I download it?!
oh wow i love this! i hope you‚Äôll post a link when you‚Äôre finished!
That's super cool! Kind of reminds me of the Plasticraft texture pack in a way
"Reminds me of South Park a lot. Keep up the good work OP, looking forward to the finished product."
Looks kind of like South Park. I want it!

I really thought you just drew a picture of your Minecraft house
Waiting for Finn the human and Jake the dog to pop out.
"Although the screenshot looks cool at first, there is nothing especially groundbreaking here. In fact I'm willing to argue there is nothing here at all.

Looking at the textures themselves, they are extremely bad. They appear as if they were hand drawn with the paint brush tool and a mouse -- which i'm willing to bet they were -- and were probably all done in one attempt. Although you could argue this is the artist's intended ""style,"" it is no excuse for bad execution and lazy texturing. For example, the artist didn't even bother to make sure the textures lined up with repeated blocks (this can be seen in the oak wood to the left). This is basic tiling and is merely laziness toward a problem that could easily be fixed in a few seconds. The pack also doesn't seem to have much consistency at all. For example the torches have a gradient, but the ladder doesn't, even though they are both essentially rounded wood; and the oak trap door on the left of the screenshot has a noisy thick black border which isn't seen on any of the other textures. The ""style"" is all over the place.

Let's move on to the torches; the artist attempted to shade them -- if you could call it that -- by highlighting one side of the torch, however once again this is poorly done, with the highlight stopping 3/4ths of the way to the bottom of the torch, even though the torch itself is a flat surface. You can see how the torch would be properly shaded by simply looking at the Minecraft default textures. I would also like to touch on the flame of the torch, I'm guessing by the gradient we can see on the top of the torch body that the artist used a simple spray brush tool for the effect, and most likely used this same tool for the flame of the torch. However they obviously didn't have an understanding of how Minecraft models work, and instead of getting the gradient effect they hoped for, they got what amounts to an orange blob on the top of the torch (Due to the fact that torches in Minecraft do not support transparent textures)

It is interesting as well to note that the torches themselves have a custom model applied; the default vanilla torches as we all know are rectangular and don't ""stick out"" at the flame. Due to the fact that we've already established that the artist has a very rudimentary knowledge and skill set when it comes to Minecraft resource packs, I find it EXTREMELY hard to believe they made this model themselves. For the uneducated, it really isn't very hard to rip a model from someone else's resource pack and plug it into your own, with your custom texture thrown on top (which I'm willing to bet is exactly what this person did).

Finally the kicker; the lighting. ""What does lighting have to do with anything?"" you're probably asking yourself. Well actually it has everything to do with it, and I'll explain why. The reason this screenshot is so highly upvoted is because the artist succeeded; they made their Minecraft look like a drawing, in fact when I first scrolled past this I thought it WAS a drawing. We've already assessed how poorly done the textures are, but funny enough they actually have very little to do with the ""cartoony"" look we see in front of us; it's the lighting that gives it the real hand drawn look.

What do I mean? Well notice how the blocks right next to the torches are just as lit as the blocks that are farther away from the torches? This is an effect that can only be achieved through setting your games brightness all the way up (they most likely also have smooth lighting turned off). This effectively shades every block exactly the same; the wood on the floor next to the ladder looks exactly like the wood on the floor right under the torch. Every block in this scene is lit exactly the same, removing all shading from the blocks. What else has the effect of everything being the same shade? A drawing.

And that's the truth of it here folks. This person hasn't actually made their Minecraft look like a drawing through texturing or modeling, no. They merely turned down their game settings to remove any sort of shading or ambient occlusion, and slapped on some half-assed MS paint textures they slapped together in a few minutes. It's their lighting settings that make their game look like a drawing, not their textures.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
Now we need a texture pack that makes everything look like anime
This could be really cool for maps. Not the paper kind
Narrator: ‚ÄúSteve decided to go outside and chop wood.‚Äù
I love it! I‚Äôd suggest making the wood blocks connect better though
"Looks awesome, can't wait to see the final product!"
reminds me of the puzzle game The Witness
Looks cool
Reminds me of Adventure Time for some reason
Looks good. ;)
"That‚Äôs beautiful, keep up the great work"
I will definitely install. Looks awesome
Its like the simpsons lol thats cool
DAMN
"This is cool! I'm working on one that's Adventure Time themed because the normal one is out of date ""or I can't find the right one"" and this reminds me if it a lot just because of the simple look and feel"
**Give Me it now**
Commenting so I can return later for updates.

You should make animals like a kids drawing
"plot twist, this is a drawing"

"This reminds me of Ed, Edd n‚Äô Eddy"
"Good luck! I would love to see this pack on my world. Keep working on it, and I'm sure everyone will love it"
"ok, that's oddly adorable. Definitely gonna install it once you've finished making it"
Nice drawing
FINALLY! A texture pack that I actually like as much as vanilla.
"I really like this, it gives like a kinda ed edd and eddy vibe and I love it"
u sure u didnt just drawn a minecraft house?
When you're finish please link it. I'd love to have this.
This + Gel shaders will slap
This is so good and adorable!!! Any idea when it will be finished?
Pls make mobile
"Very, very nice! I love the artistic look."
Plot twist. The screenshot is actually a drawing
Pretty cool my lad
"Can't wait, looks amazing"
This looks really great so far. Do you plan on uploading it to a mc website like planet Minecraft or 9minecraft because if so I would totally use the finished product.
"9/10 would recommend.

Needs depth and glass and bed textures to look more cartoonish. But as stated you are still working on it, so keep up the good work!"
Yo I legit thought this was a drawing... well I guess you succeeded!
"Oh boy, I wish my PC was working to test this texture pack :/"
"It looks like the Simpsons! Really cool though, good work."
You should add lines to the edges of blocks i think
"Don‚Äôt remember the texture pack used, but it reminds me of the one in Minecraft for noobs cartoon."
If it's downloadable I'd love to use it.
"Isnt minecraft technically drawn already, just in pixels? No offense."
How do i get it when youre done
Nice
"Neato burrito, looks good so far"
What version is it gonna be on?
When can I find the full release and where will it be?
More like a painting to me a drawing would be more pencil or penlike

Yum

Looks awesome!
Approved ‚úÖ
Can you show where to download when your finished?

Make sure to let us know when it‚Äôs ready to be downloaded.
Love this :)
"This is giving me strong BATIM vibes, very nice"
Hell yeah.
This seems really cool. It kind of reminds me of the plastic texture pack
Noice
Will it be on Bedrock? (Prepare for the downvotes)
This is TBD we‚Äôll see once I finish.
Use Comic Sans for the signs as a font :P
Tip: make the lines connect on the edges by giving them the same horizontal or vertical position at the start and end
personally the planks should line up at the end and beginning of each block but otherwise good
you can do it from ur phone with ISO pix
"To early to say, stay posted for more progress!"
I'd love to see how animals are like
Yes plz
make it for both java and windows edition pls
That looks really cool!
Looks nice! Reminds me of Wind Waker. Looking forward to seeing it when you're finished!
Damn that looks nice!
"This is fucking AWESOME! 

Please keep us updated once it‚Äôs done."
Looks amazing
I‚Äôll take your entire stock
This honestly would make my head hurt a lot less after a full day of playing it
I guess you could say that‚Äôs a little sketchy
"I hope this gets a bedrock port too, so I can use it on mobile and stuff"
"beautiful :,)"
 Never have I seen a concept so strange yet so beautifully executed! Insanely good job you gotta keep us updated
Please tell me I can download this somewhere OP
Oh my god this is freaking amazing!! Please do post once it's done. I would really love to use it
"If this isn't called ""ScribbleCraft"" I will TNT Minecraft myself.
Edit: spelling error"
I kinda get an adventure time vibe from it
CONNECT THE PLANK TEXTURE!!!!
I really love this and can‚Äôt wait to see it finished!!
Oh wow! Def want a download when it's done!
I‚Äôm not saying I smoke weed. Because I don‚Äôt. But all I‚Äôm saying is that this would be awesome to play while high with that texture pack
"You say drawing, I say Wind Waker."
take my fricking upvote
It s sooooo damn cool.
What are you going to do with the glass?
I love it
"Thank you Quintincan, very cool"
"Congratulations, you‚Äôve made Unturned."
I nEeD tHiS
"So far, so good! Keep it up!"
Is it possible to get a download for this?
I never really got into it for some reason. I like the concept and I've played with my little brother sometimes and just build random shit lol
"You'd be better off writing a non-photorealistic rendering shader for the existing shader pack mods.  This, doesn't look good at all."
"This looks awesome, can't wait for it to be finished. Keep up the good work!

Amazing..."
It looks cute. I like it
"I don't need it I don't need it
I NEEED IT"
Bruh this is just unturned
Looks like unturned
"Kinda reminded me of Borderlands, is there a cel-shaded texture pack?"
The torches are üëå
That‚Äôs relaxingly cute
Do u have a link for it
Suggestion: make the oak wood planks end with it starts to make it look more joining
"Reminds me of the Simpsons.

Also the beds being the original still looks very odd next to the custom textures."
That is super cool!! It reminds me of Firewatch. Is there a link to try it out? What do the mobs look like and villagers?
Will this be added on Xbox? This looks really cool and I'd love to play with it added
Ohh that's awesome
I WANT TO TRY IT OUT!!!!
The Texture Pack with No Name
I‚Äôd download this! Can‚Äôt wait til it‚Äôs done
"Oohh, it looks good"
i am milfly infuriated that the pllanks lines don't fully match up
"The lines on the planks dont link up, you should fix that."
"Hey, that's pretty cool!"
I never use texture packs. Not my kind of thing. This one though. I would pay money for this.
Amazing!
Yo this is pretty cool. A lot different than hyper realism texture packs which are all over the place. I could honestly see this being used to make some kind of minecraft mini series or a short film of some kind. Really interested and am looking forward to when you release it!
"This looks really cool, what you releasing it on?"
Make planks line up
I‚Äôm getting Adventure Time feels from this for some reason... and that‚Äôs a good thing. Great job.
Fuck nice work
"Looks good so far, noticed the wood planks aren't 100% aligned!"
Is it just me or theres a simpsons vibe to it?
Nice dude
lookin hecka spicy brother. are u gunna put it up for download cus i would use it
"One thing I noticed was that the lines on the wood don‚Äôt quite match up like in the vanilla texture pack. Don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs intentional or not. Still, I can‚Äôt wait to see the finished product! Keep up the good work!"
You should put a link so people can use it
I get a MS Paint vibe from this and I love it
Plot twist this picture is a drawing
Thats actually dope
Pair this with the cel shaders shaders üëå
Download link?
atleast align the lines on the wood
"Bai needs to go to art school!

;p"
When you want minecraft to look like the town with no name
@ me when you're done lmao
What version is this for?
It looks kinda like Facade
You need to make your textures tilable.
I though there already one
I thought it was a drawing until I read the description
That looks like camp crystal lake and someone is about to pop out with a machete...
Oh no
Cool
Reminds me of Minecraft 4kids
":√Æ""√´






Give please"
"STE    IS  YOU  
 VE"
This is so beautiful
I just realized I want a Dr. Katz squiggle vision texture pack.
"a0qsp,woo0qqq1 ,√ó0Aa"
Thanks means a lot to me!
What version will it be for?
Definitely will want to see this once released
Wow that‚Äôs really cool. I can‚Äôt wait till it‚Äôs done
all the way yes x 1001
Give link
MS Painters are proud
It looks like my first try to make my own pack. But it still looks good
"Oh this, I like this. Would it be possible for a poor Xbox one player to use it? Because I would love to use it"
"This is awesome. You just made me realize how awesome it would be if someone did this but with watercolour, i now really want a watercolour texture pack for minecraft."
This makes me want a south park texture pack
This just reminded me forcibly of playing Drawn To Life:Spongebob Edition on my Nintendo DS Lite
"I want it, when is it out?"
I love it! Where would we be able to get updates from?
i hope you make the character textures look like fsjal drawings that would he hilarious.
Really cool! Reminds me of Adventure Time.
"Where will the texturpack be after ur done?
It looks rad"
reminds me of unturned
I'm getting South Park vibes
"Ive never played it before, but with this, I would start."
WOAH. I want that!
"Gives me lots of unturned vibes which is pretty sweet , keep up the good work"
Yo I'm using this 100% when it comes out
Ok epic
Papercraft.
looks a bit like adventure time
MS paint?
This kinda looks like Unturned
Looks on point man
I was waiting for the GIF to begin playing
looks really similar to unturned's art style
This is so weird. It's amazing
i really wanna play with this texture pack. it looks great!
Reminds me of borderlands
That‚Äôs unique and I quite like it
"Looks kind of like rec room, so cool!"
This is so cool! I‚Äôll definitely download it once it‚Äôs ready.
Pretty darn nice chief!
That looks absolutely awesome!
Epic adventure map resource pack
How do we know you didn't just draw this?
What if it is a drawing!
You mean the default?
This looks like an episode of Blues Clues
I like that the planks edges don‚Äôt line up perfectly. It‚Äôs a subtle reminder of sorts that they‚Äôre still blocks.
Can somebody explain to me how to make an original resource pack?
Do it in ms paint for that ‚Äúcrisp‚Äù look
lmk when done! bc i want to download!!
This looks fantastic! Keep up the great work :)
It's like Ed Edd + Eddy jajaja
Please Bedrock
Minecraft: Borderlands edition
When can I get it?
"Pm me when its done too please, if possible id also like the bedrock edition too"
Me need download
Please post when this is made I will regularly use this ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
Looks like the simpsons kinda
This is epic
What would you name it?
I would love to use this texture pack.
"Great job!
It remind me the ""XIII"" game on PS2.
One of the best game ever, the graphics was like the comics."
This is my favorite texture pack I‚Äôve seen so far! It‚Äôs fantastic!!
Nice job looks great when will it be finished I want to download it
This might go really well for my pixelmon game
Looks phenomenal! Can‚Äôt wait to see the final product. Will definitely use
These torches are really lit.
"Made with paint lol.

Can you say to me what's the resolution? I liked but high resolution can lag the PC."
Why two beds?
got those rick and morty vibes
ok
"Ed, Edd n Eddy"
is this unturned?
adventure time
I‚Äôll buy this for sure if it comes to bedrock
Gonna be honest I legit thought this was a drawing before I read the title
Adventure time baby
Looks like adventure time!
!remind me 1 week
I didn't know I needed this until just now O.O Looking forward to it's release!! Nicely done!
Looks cool but bruh you really need to work on your tiling
nice
Looks great! Please make it for bedrock!!! I would love it!
!remind me 1 week
"Oh I love this. Very much feels like Minecraft fed through a cel shading filter. Would absolutely use this pack.  
  
Well done. I look forward to it being finished."
really nice door drawing /s
When and where will this be available?!?!
"I like it, but I‚Äôm on Xbox so I can‚Äôt use it"
It looks like unturned lol
The planks need to line up other than that this pack looks fantastic
Cap your frames at 15 to make it look like a stop motion hand drawn animation.
"Looks like the plastic, except better"
"Definitely not something I would use, but really cool you are making this I am sure others will love it."
It reminds me of unturned
"That‚Äôs really cool, man. Keep up the good work!"
Reminds me of Mega Man Legends for the PSX.  Looks great!
Bob Ross would be proud
"This is really cool, well done!"
South Park\^\^
This reminds me of a texture pack created with only ms paint
Very epic
Scribblenauts resource pack
Wind Waker esque
Loooooove it
Looks fantastic!
Go on collect your arrows
"Damn man, awesome. If I wasn't a performance freak who uses 16*16 (also only my desktop can handle that and I frequent my laptop), I'd be all over this"
Hmm.. are you sure that isn't a drawing?
Too bad Console can't have fun.
This got me excited. Gives Mc a fresh feel like I‚Äôm seeing it for the first time all over again
This could be a drawing
Low key getting adventure time vibes but I like it
It kinda reminds me of unturned if anyone remembers that game.
Very cool
I absolutely love and need this in my life
When this is finished you know I‚Äôm downloading
How do you make texture packs?? This is really cool!
That totally looks like cell shading that will be a fun pack can't wait to see it when you finish it.
"I love it, but if you look on the wood planks, they kinda don't match up, like the lines don't match up so they don't really flow. But other than that, it looks greattt"
"Can you update me with a way to download texture packs and mods on my son's xbox one? No matter what I try, I always hit a snag and give up. I've tried numerous times over the last two years."
please tell us when this releases! i really want this pack it looks very good.
"If you want to make sure your texture will tile in Photoshop, you can use filer>offset then set the horizontal or vertical amount to half the pictures width, then just repeat to put it back to normal"
This is awesome
"Thanks for the feedback, I plan on cleaning up the texture pack a bit before I release it."
"Yeah, the most difficult thing about making textures (for any game) is making them seamless, i.e. ensuring you can't easily notice they are tiled."
"If the block edges were shown, I'm pretty sure it look less like a drawing, and more like Minecraft with a cartoony texture pack.

&#x200B;

Maybe I'm not picturing what you had in mind correctly though."
All textures are 256x256
It reminds me of Unturned!
I miss that show
Probably because it was also hand drawn.
come on grab your friends
I'm getting a South Park vibe from it.
**Mega A++**
organic?
You don't need mods to edit particles
"I‚Äôm going to try and finish before the end of the month, but I don‚Äôt know what to do for items and entities, so it might take longer. I‚Äôm always open for suggestions"
Nice
"That's what I thought at first, but even more fitting is South Park, I think."
"I‚Äôm very early on in development, I‚Äôve only been working on it for a day now but I definitely plan on posting updates as I go along."
Honestly reckon it looks a lot more like wind waker.
It would be cash money
"Ya that‚Äôs kinda what everyone said, if you read the other comment I already said I was going to before finishing and that I‚Äôve only been working on it for a day. I appreciate the feedback though!"
"This is my first day of progress but when it is finished I‚Äôll make it public, I‚Äôll also be posting updates as I go."
Happy cake day
"This is a question I have no answer to yet this is my first day of progress and when I finish the texture pack, I‚Äôll see what I can do."
Thanks man! I‚Äôm open to any feedback you have as well
"I like the idea, I might incorporate it with other items and not animals tho"
Thanks! I‚Äôm just glad people enjoy it
Thanks! I plan on posting updates to this pack as I go on.
Thanks!
"Yes, that‚Äôs the plan"
"I tried but some blocks look better with lines than others, we‚Äôll see in future updates."
It will be done when I finish it but I‚Äôm going to work hard at a deadline within the next month or two!
Thanks stay posted for future updates!
I‚Äôll be leaving updates as I progress.
"He‚Äôs been saying it‚Äôs a little early to say for sure. But I‚Äôm not super hopeful, just cuz I‚Äôm a pessimist"
"This was my first day of progress, I will have a downloadable version when finished."
Thanks the positive feedback mean the world to me!
"This is the first day of progress, there will be a link when finished, and posts for updates"
Haha stay posted for updates
It works! Thanks man.
"Simplified version: Go to the wiki, to resource packs, and download the files. From then, find the mob textures, and edit or replace them to be whatever you want."
"It‚Äôs kinda hard for me to explain because I‚Äôm still figuring it out for myself, this is my first texture pack, but I plan on finishing it."
"Just open up Photoshop and start drawing every block. Then read on the wiki how to sort them into folders, create a few text files and a texture pack will appear out of nowhere.

If you want to go further you can even add custom sounds and 3D models, but that requires even more text file editing."
You can use the Minecraft wiki to have a basic tutorial
"Download a texture pack, then open it up, and edit any textures that you want to change and save (don't redistribute other peoples work please).  I used to do this for glass as I hated the Minecraft glass with it's smudges, so found a texture pack and edited it's glass to be what I wanted and removed everything else so only the glass would change in Minecraft from the original textures."
"There's a neat trick you can do: once you have done the texture, offset it by 50% (both Photoshop and GIMP have this feature, Paint.net should also have it somewhere) so that you get the edges crossing at the center, then smooth out them. Offset it again and it will be seamless."
Looks great though. Keep it up :)
How do I follow its release? I‚Äôve gotten back into Minecraft and would love something to replace sphax as my go to. And this is wonderful!
"In saying that, your ladders are great!"
Personally I think the fact they don't connect just adds to the feeling that it's drawing
"If you look at the top left, you can see the edge of the two blocks, because the lines don't connect right. They're just saying that they should get those lines to connect right so you don't see individual blocks when you're looking at it."
The line on the oak planks don't connect so it's obvious that they're different blocks. They mean that block edges should be seamless.
That seems awfully high for relatively simple textures.
Omg I love unturned.. does anyone still play?
I love unturned!

That show was so simple and then it would go balls deep on making you really think outta nowhere. Then BMO would fart or something and you‚Äôre back.

You need some sort of mailing list. Hahah

Please post when done I would totally download and like it.
Nice
"Well good luck, it looks awesome!"
"Wow thanks, I didn't realize it was. Should post for free karma now.."
"I think that it looks nice, and I already saw a comment that talked about the edges connecting so other than that it's good. What did you use to make the textures cause all I have is paint.net

Or just open in MSpaint and redo them
"Something I was wondering is whether you can make glowing textures by doing this. I wanted to make ores glow in the dark, among other things. Probably have to go with outright modding though."

You need more detail to sell the ‚Äúdrawn‚Äù lines.
"if it wasn't high the lines would be blocky, the more detail makes the lines smooth giving it the drawn effect."
Even 512x can be improved upon by some packs

Do you know anything about custom block modelling? I'm having some real troubles with mine.
"Mspaint only works for full block textures though, because the backround is always white and you can't easily remove it"
Paint.net is way better
"The texture itself doesn‚Äôt glow. You can make it neon and stand out more, but it would still be hard to see. To do what you want to do, you may want to look into behavior packs, the code for the endermans eyes and see if you can edit the ore. If not, datapacks (if you play on Java) are your best bet."
"It does, but it sucks. This is coming from the world's  biggest GIMP stan. It basically just blurs the corners."

ah ok.
exactly
paint.net is shit. gimp is so much better for packs
You can also use pixlr
I just use Paint 3D since it's the easiest
"GIMP is such a good product, it‚Äôs too bad that the latest version had a lot of performance issues thanks to poor optimization. I do my art on a refurbished 2013 MacBook Air which is kinda my fault, but the most recent version of photoshop runs seamless on it regardless so I have to lay a bit of the blame on GIMP."

Gimp is garbage. Photoshop

I saw this last night and I wondered wtf was going on. Like how the OP couldn‚Äôt tell the sarcasm that was so evident.
Half of everything on r/facepalm is like that
The 212 upvotes are the real tragedy
Ironic how many facepalm posts are from a subreddit for these posts
r/sarcasmception
It's obvious joke
You mean the OP of this post couldnt tell the comment was sarcastic?
This is big brain time

Og post pls
Isn't this pretty ironic ... I mean it literally describes what flat earthers do all the time ...
"Flat-earthers are dumb as fuck go rot in hell, oh excuse me srry go to what ever flat region you think is bad you dumb fucks.
(Dudes I can tell the sarcasm, but flat earthers fuck you, I just really hate dumb ppl like antivaxers, flat-earthers, and ect)"
Most of this subreddit is people not understanding what a joke is

"You say the OP didn't detect sarcasm, but what if they did detect it and the OP is, in fact, a Flat Earther?"

I'm pretty sure they're calling flatearthers dumb
"That‚Äôs a whole lot more evidence than a lot of people need, apparently."

So nukes aren‚Äôt a thing huh. They also say they believe in the physics of nuclear energy and that Chernobyl and what not were real but apparently it‚Äôs impossible to harness that energy for a bomb. Also Hiroshima and Nagasaki were conventional explosives... apparently.

"The Zetetic Method
The theory follows from a mode of thought called the ""Zetetic Method,"" an alternative to the scientific method, developed by a 19th-century flat-earther, in which sensory observations reign supreme. ""Broadly, the method places a lot of emphasis on reconciling empiricism and rationalism, and making logical deductions based on empirical data,"" Flat Earth Society vice president Michael Wilmore, an Irishman, told Life's Little Mysteries. In Zetetic astronomy, the perception that Earth is flat leads to the deduction that it must actually be flat; the antimoon, NASA conspiracy and all the rest of it are just rationalizations for how that might work in practice."

Posting r/facepalm to r/facepalm is basically cheating.

"Congratulations, you just played yourself."
Am I out of the loop on this? It does seem like OP is being sarcastic?
Maybe it's been a massive misunderstanding all along. Maybe they mean the ground is flat? I mean as far as you can see it pretty much is.
OP of the post is also twelve so no bullying guys
/r/facepalm is unintentionally the most meta sub that ever existed
Am I stupid too or isn't he saying that it's a facepalm that something debunking a flat Earth is coming from a flat Earth page?

Maybe it was sarcasm to not understand sarcasm?

"I don't think they can't detect sarcasm, I think they're actually stupid.  Obviously a basketball is not flat and no matter how many times you zoom in on it, it will never be flat.  That was the point of the picture.  They think a zoomed in picture of a basketball that makes it seem flat actually makes a basketball flat.  That's just dumb."
Hey I saw this post and also downvoted it! This sub is full of bumbling idiots who don‚Äôt understand the concepts of irony or sarcasm. It‚Äôs pathetic.
Can't read sarcasm because he's 10.
That's a trolling.  Not facepalm
this has to be someone trolling the flat earth subreddit
Does OP stand for Old People?
"I must have missed something because I thought the OP was taking the piss from Flat Earth theory.

EDIT: Oh, I didn't notice this was crossposted."
Because some people literally believe in any theory these days. Sarcasm can't always be used to dismiss questionable statements
"This is why we need to abolish the /s, people have to learn how to detect sarcasm again"
The real facepalm on /r/facepalm is always the facepalmer.

I thought r/flatearth is a satirical sub
Bc they're a flat earther
And how like 200+ people had upvoted it
T_D is leaking. The relative IQ of reddit is dropping by the minute.
"Possibly because this is exactly the sort of twisted logic you'd see from a flat earther.  ""hey guys I think I'm onto something big here!  Spheres are just an illusion that comes from looking at things in too broad a way!"""
"Probably American, they wouldn't know sarcasm if it punched them in the face."
Is the other half people pointing those out?
The sarcasm isn't always this ridiculously obvious
"I saw it at 500 upvotes

Edit: How times have changed..."
Also entirely possible someone upvoted the image/joke and didn't even notice the fact someone took this seriously.
I just checked the post. It's 307 now üôÅ

"It‚Äôs 212 downvotes, you can get back faith in humanity :)"
"To be fair, a lot of times people don't notice the subreddit when they upvote a post."
I'm upvoting this because it took me a really long time to understand the OP in this post title means the OP who cross posted this from r/flatearthers. They don't understand it was posted to flatearthers ironically.
"GOD DAMN IT, MAKE IT A THING I FELL FOR IT"
"Clearly. I mean, for one thing the P900 is a bridge camera, not an interchangeable lens system, so it doesn‚Äôt have a macro lens. It may have a macro shooting mode for its one and only lens, but if they can‚Äôt even use the correct terminology when talking about their equipment, how can I be expected to take their results seriously?

Edit, I now realise that they were using a macro adapter..."
As is anyone who believes in flat earth.
Flat earthers exist for the sole purpose of highlighting the portion of society that doesn't understand trolling.
I dont get what people mean when they are saying it is sarcasm. are all of u saying that its sarcasm because hes joking about the evidence. Or are all u saying that a ball is in fact not round and everybody who was saying it was is joking?
"If you think of the the garbage that flatearthers come up with to try to prove the earth is flat, I'd believe this is real. 

Some of these people literally dont have the same definition of ""curved"" or ""flat"" that normal people do."
"I don‚Äôt know man, some people are bat shit crazy. I went to a subreddit called r/earthisntreal (I don‚Äôt remember the exact name of the sub but it was something like that) and it took me like an hour going through that sub because I couldn‚Äôt tell if they were being serious or joking around but after a while of reading comments, it turns out that that community actually believes in that shit. I was seriously shocked that anyone could believe something so absurd in my opinion."
"But it‚Äôs facepalm material because someone posted it to r/flatearthers, presumably without irony.

EDIT: Haha, ohhhh now I see."
"OP of the original post couldn't tell the comment was sarcastic, OP of this post couldn't write a clear title."
I'm confused. Is this a repost of a cross post of a comment? What the fuck is this?
I'll find it hold on
"and yet, If I told you that I think folks who believe a man can transform into a woman are on the same level as flat-earthers, climate change deniers and anti-vaccine nutjobs... you'd probably have a reddit meltdown."

"I do *not* have the patience to watch those, TLDW?"

"That's what I thought, that the OP was being sarcastic. I'm fucking lost."
I am not sure if was crossposted as much as OP put that in the title cause that means more sweet delicious karma I guess.
r/flatearthers was an unmoderated sub. It's not like it was a real flatearther that thought the basketball was flat. The original post was sarcastic.
Op must have been trolling. A crosspost doesn‚Äôt prove anything. Does he double down in the comments?
Too many layers of irony.

then we have the further complication of people who can't detect sarcasm, regardless of context or cues. low social intelligence. you can't really cure that"
It is. But the person posted this here thinking it was serious when it definitely wasn‚Äôt.

"Obviously!

"https://imgur.com/gallery/nSGtPtz

Copied from a comment"
They def screwed on a macro adapter in front of the built in lens
"They used a third party magnifying lens mounted on the integrated lens. 

The camera choice for the joke is on point though, since for some reason flat earthers seem fixated on the P900 & P1000 and how they can somehow be used to ""prove"" that the planet is flat. I guess they think they can ""zoom to the edge of the earth"" with them or something.

Funny, considering the cameras have enough zoom to capture the International Space Station pretty clearly. I guess they'll just claim it's a drone or something."
Teach the controversy!
"No it‚Äôs facepalm because it was posted to facepalm so the dude who posted this took a screenshot of the facepalm and posted it to facepalm. 

In other words look at the full image"

"It‚Äôs double OP, the original post is sarcastic but if you look again you‚Äôll see someone else posted it to r/facepalm and didn‚Äôt notice it was sarcastic."
People have been generally fucking stupid since we became people. Nothing special about ‚Äúthese days.‚Äù
[Theeeeeeeeeeeese dayyyyyyyyys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0_z_UEuEMAo)
I assume someone's well-intentioned and reasonable and making a joke until proven otherwise. Makes life more enjoyable.
"Easy to detect tone if the person makes a focused effort to get the tone across. Sometimes this means exaggerating a little more than if spoken. Learn to convey it better or have more confidence in your audience, the bulk of whom actually do get most textual sarcasm.

Edit: Oh *noooo* please don't downvote me."
"It‚ÄôS AlWayS DiFFIcUlt tO DetECT tONE in TeXT

I'm actually confused now bc I dont know if ur being sarcastic or if ur serious and put the /s there to confuse me

""must've been an arrow!"""
Just a normal day on reddit when people do an oopsie
I saw the post and upvoted because I didn't realize what sub it was posted on. Woops. Time to go through my upvote history.
"But... The post was screenshotted at 212, so how could half of the 500 see this post before it was posted?"
I don't get it
they'll loose interest and just go back to petitioning netlflix to stop showing GOT.
I went to look and can't find the sub. Did they lock it maybe?
Doing work.
"Fucking sheep, we‚Äôre all a bunch of fucking sheep, lol"
"I mean... it‚Äôs still a facepalm, just a naked one"
I think it's more to do with people not checking what sub this is in.
Its satirising rather than sarcastic technically.
the post is on r/facepalm
I think the person who posted it there just didn't understand how /r/facepalm works.
"... I may be dumb, but the down facing arrow in blue doesn‚Äôt mean downvote? That is a true question, not /s"
"Safety in numbers, brother!"
"You and me, both. I don't get it. Yes, original post was a joke at flat earther's expense. Seems that would be sarcasm. But the x-post says he can't detect it when it is exactly what it was."
It got banned 7 months ago for being unmoderated
r/theworldisflat is the crazy one. r/flatearthers was memes about flat earthers (banned for being unmoderated)
>This subreddit was banned due to being unmoderated.
"It was a sarcastic sub like kinda like /r/Pyongyang, except  anyone was allowed to post because it was unmoderated. /r/Pyongyang is a joke in itself because the mods pretended to be NK government.

Anyone who actually believes a flat earther community exists on reddit is an idiot."
Played us like a damn fiddle
Son of a-
"Edit: Dude, it looks like it‚Äôs getting new content now!"
r/birthofasub
"For real. I already knew that of course, but I'm glad they explained it for everyone else. Pretty obvious though."
This still just looks like an over-elaborated joke.
"Ahh, well that explains things then."
There‚Äôs also the fact that I completely forgot about the existence of screw on macro adapters...
"They do have insanely long 35mm equivalent focal lengths, mainly due to so having a tiny sensor. I wonder if anyone at Nikon knows about the flat earth association?"
https://www.reddit.com/r/facepalm/comments/cck2qi/xpost_from_rflatearthers/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
"Oh wait, YOU made those? I thought it was gonna be flat earther garbage"
"Just bad sarcasm, bad joke. See it's not funny"
Thanks!...I guess.
Before they edited their comment
THE EARTH HAS NO LAYERS
"Exactly. 

First post was posted into r/flatearthers to take the piss."
Did someone else then repost this mistake to r/facepalm
Especially these days
"Just default to good old ""benefit of the doubt"":  if there are multiple reasonable ways to interpret a statement and the intent isn't overtly obvious, assume the least malicious or more most generous interpretation is correct (until more clarifying information arises)."
"*defends people being able to detect textual sarcasm*

*uses italics to indicate sarcasm*"
Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
I‚Äôm serious ^^^^/s
"Oopsie poopsie, doopsie woopsie"
We did it reddit.
"We did it, Reddit"
"No. People just assume that they're correct, based on what the hivemind and populistic vote system tells them to think"
"People noticed before this post, maybe?"
"Exactly. Someone browsing All sees a post, gets a kick out of it and upvotes. I've been guilty of that on occasion before I check the comments."
I don't even know what day it is anymore. What the hell's going on. It's all jokes.
"nah, it's cool.  the downfacing arrow in blue means OP downvoted the post. if it were into negative downvotes it would say -212 regardless of the color of the highlighted arrow."
It just means OP downvoted the post themselves
Means whoever screenshot this downvoted it first
/r/facepalm
Kinda feels bad man. They‚Äôre fun to observe from a safe distance from time to time if I‚Äôm ever feeling dumb
"/r/theworldisflat 

Anyone who thinks that Reddit consists only of the larger and meme-able subs and doesn't contain many many smaller fringe communities is an idiot."
You're pretty good.
"I didn't link that to see if it was a joke or not, I was linking that because the of the equipment used"
"And even if it was built in, I'd still say it has a macro lens. Just that you can't swap it out. Gotta be careful with the wording is all"
Niceüëç

"Little of column A, little of column B"
Thing was I realised after and thought shit you daft twat... Oh well
you've earned it
"ah I missed the edit, thank you"
"yes it does, just like an onion

and as we all know, an onion is perfectly flat"
"Its turtles, all the way down!"
r/noearththeory
"YA, THE EARTH ISIN'T A [BLOONIN ONION](https://i1.wp.com/www.foodandsunshine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/paleobloomingonion.jpg?zoom=2.625&resize=371%2C412)"
I‚Äôm so confused
But that isn't a subreddit...
"Wow that sucks, I was hoping I could check out that sub. But it's locked."
Been bamboozled by a god damn bot lmao
Thus proving my point and changing my karma score from -1 to 3! Karma is a lucrative business this means so much to me.
Yes probably but the person I replied to said they saw this post and then went back to downvote
Or most people know its sarcastic and upvote because its funny.
You are completely right (of course)... and now I feel dumb and I‚Äôve lost faith in humanity... I think that I badly wanted people to be smarter than me :)
One correction: if it were in the negatives it would only display 0.
"I'm pretty sure r/theworldisflat was the ""serious"" one"
But those engravings give you no tactical advantage whatsoever.
You make a good point
"Meh, I slapped it into my watch later"
How can onions be real if our eyes aren‚Äôt real?
It‚Äôs a jawbreaker!
"Basketball image from the start was sarcastic, and someone posted it to the flat earth sub to make fun of them. 

OP from the first facepalm post thought a flat earther believed this, and it was serious, so they posted it on facepalm to make fun of them. 

OP didn‚Äôt realize the ‚Äúflat earther who believed it‚Äù was making fun of them, so OP facepalmed themselves by not understanding the sarcasm."
"*To take the piss out of flat earthers I mean. 

That image with the ball and the zoomed in shot of the surface was meant to be funny and to make fun of people who believe the earth is flat."
me too
Everyone's a bot. You can never be too careful these days.
Might be coming into human flesh.
"don't worry about it, it's just reddit.  have a fantastic day/evening, wherever you are!"
i'm fairly sure i would get downvoted to shit if i were wrong.
"Oh, nice. There‚Äôs a lot of unmoderated subs still up so the serious flat earthers must of reported the hell out of them. Glad I can still observe them in their natural habitat though"
My blood just boiled reading through some of that garbage.
Well that was a good rabbit hole to waste the morning away with. Thanks for that
That‚Äôs quite a number of morons gathering in one place.
Reading through that subreddit gave me a headache it was so nonsensical
"Something, something, *long silver bullet*, something, something, *well greased chamber*."
It's facepalms all the way down
This just shows how funny they are.
Especially these days
"Thanks, u too! I‚Äôm family vacation in Italy, so it is a fantastic week! Hope you are not working behind a computer screen in a dark basement right now!"
"And then your comment would be negative. But if you made a post and got downvoted, the post would stop displaying new values below 0 even if the actual value were something like -212."
I recommend you dont engage with them then. Incredibly frustrating listening to them make empty arguments.
r/birthofasub
I facepalm how long it took me to figure it all out. I felt like I completed a puzzle after typing all that.
Favorite comment in a looooong time
So true. You're one of the good ones.
">Hope you are not working behind a computer screen in a dark basement right now!

I feel personally attacked."
Are you my FBI agent?
so posts never have a negative figure üòÆ ?
"then why does /r/explainmydownvotes have screenshots of posts with negative karma? 

not trying to argue, this is an honest question"
"I got banned from that sub, and want to know their hilarious reason? 

‚ÄúNo time for children who believe in moon landing fables‚Äù

THAT is something worthy of an r/facepalm post"
. . .
"Don't worry, I respect your life choices."
No
Correct. It's weird.
"Because those are all comments, not posts."

Now they can have fun together and joergen will share the melon he gets from pewdsüò¢‚ò∫ rip watersheep.  F
Hope he lives a happy life on the other side. This side was hell for him.
"Hopefully him and Joergen‚Äôs souls will help keep Sven alive, because he has almost died a LOT"
Joegen was the only one who ever loved him üò¢ üçâ
At least Joergen will appreciate him unlike some Swede who has royally pissed many people off during his 14th Minecraft video.
They will chat together
Let's hope that Joergen #1 won't be such an ass to water sheep like Felix.
Felix should make a beautiful grave/memorial for water sheep next to j√∂rgen

Was I a good sheep?

no u
"I'm not crying, my eyes are sweaty"
its because we knew joergen for like 4 episodes and knew water sheep for 14.
Jeorgen had a good life at least...
Water sheep was innocent its whole life and had to live in a confined space dealing with daily abuse. We should all feel sorry for him.
Same. Watersheep did nothing wrong :( he just had a shitty owner.
Same
Me too
oOF same‚Äî
"he forgot to feed him, RIP Water Sheep"
Thx
He did
Thanks! I'm ok with people using my idea if they give me credit! Nice diary btw!
"I'm with you brother.

#justiceforjeb"
Normally I wouldn't agree with this... But for real... It was sad watching this video... Because I've seen almost same post yesterday when water sheep was still alive...
timestamp on the f bomb?
"you can see Felix is affected too, he regrets it"
"Legit, I was having a hard time watching this episode. 

Not just because I was sad for some pixel animals (R.I.P. jeb_), but just the way Pewds was acting. It was uncomfortable. 

So, I was lowkey laughing when he kept getting tilted in the temple."
Exactly I love pewds but Jesus I was so pissed at him after watching the episode. He kept being so extra with the stupid ass ‚Äútorture chamber‚Äù when all he had to fucking do was leave jeb in the bars. Honestly pissed just typing this
This episode was like half an hour of Pewds murdering innocent beings in inhumane ways
yeah this was my least favorite episode :/. i know it‚Äôs dumb because it‚Äôs a VIDEO GAME SHEEP but idk i loved the animals he has and wotr sheep was my favorite and the torture parts were dragged out and made me uncomfortable to watch tbh ..

Thanks friend!  I really liked your original diary entries! Really made me empathize with our poor pixilated sheep #JusticeforJeb_

"He was laughing because he was pushing a minecraft sheep with pistons left and right, if thats making you uncomfortable, then most of your life will be a nightmare"
I agree. The whole torturing part was so dragged out this episode and made me uncomfortable
"Dude its just a pixelated sheep,yeah i agree that part was kinda dark but its nothing too pissed about,he is just roleplaying the whole time,you can literally breed a sheep and get a new one just by feeding them"
"I can't believe so many people here are so sensitive as to be angry about pretend torturing a sheep in Minecraft. Yeah it's dark. That's the joke. 

Nobody seemed to be this offended when he was making child murder / incest jokes in Happy Wheels over and over again."
"Seriously. This was an uncomfortable episode, using the leash to ""hang"" the animals took it way too far."

"Men are 3 times as likely to be involved in domestic violence by getting kicked and beaten than women, yet of the 6000 cases reported, only 200 were from men.

Edit: before I get down voted into oblivion, the source is statistics Canada, so these are facts."

Not told that you were best.. I believe that you were the best..
Did he even use it once after the episode he got it? Seems like he just brings it around but only used sword/axe
oh god oh fuck
"Exactly. Nobody is annoyed because he tortured a virtual animal, people are annoyed because he dragged out a stupid joke for half the episode"
once you have something thats diferent than the others its hard to get it back it doesnt matter how easy it is to get another water sheep from the farm but it wont be the same water sheep that we knew from the start its about the memories that are made from the journey
But none of them would be water sheep:(
I‚Äôm angry because water sheep was my favorite
"It was a spoiler even when they added a spoiler tag. I know that they‚Äôve been the only people making Day diaries for each episode in Water Sheep‚Äôs perspective, so when it said ‚ÄúGoodbye‚Äù as the title and had a bunch of awards, I immediately knew what happened."

Kiel ist real. Gr√º√üe gehen raus! :)
Good job and thanks for helping to clean up the planet! Everytime I see a #trashtag post It brings happiness to my day. Keep it up!
Just steer clear of those caves near Winden.
"Check yourselves for ticks! Throw your clothes in the dryer - ticks can‚Äôt survive the heat/dryness and it will kill any that may still be in your clothes. 

Und vielen Dank!"
I absolutely love that this trend hasn't ended yet...but where does all this trash thats being globally collected end up?
Hopefully it was easier than living in your older brother Andy Samberg‚Äôs shadow.
Ex Kiel girl is proud of you üåª

Very proud of you
Hi! Gru√ü aus einer anderen Ecke von Kiel- Spitze!
Das Napoleon Dynamit
Well done! Cute gloves ;)
Sauber! Gr√ºsse aus Hessen.
Wo in Kiel ist das?War letztens erst in Kiel
Kiel is a beautiful place glad to see people are cleaning it up
I've been to Kiel! (From the US). Happy to see you keep it clean!
Not what I was expecting your girlfriend to look like but great work buddy!
Thank you for doing what you do!
Awesome. Keep the trend alive!
"Man this karma farm never stops.

We have a sub for these. r/trashtag."
"I will continue to upvote these, because I want people to keep doing it. Bravo, keep up the good work."
Hey I have family in Kiel!  Keep up the awesome work!
Ich wohne eine stunde entfernt ;) geile aktion
"Sieht nach Gaarden aus.. Falls ja, Respekt. Wie viele Ratten sind euch √ºbern Weg gelaufen? War letztens dort im Park an der Ecke von Penny und war direkt von einer Horde Ratten umgeben. Super krass."
"TIL that Germans litter.

How unGerman that seems!"
Gg wp
Thought that piece of metal at the bottom was a saber for a solid minute
*sigh*  unzipps...
Du bist sehr gut!
"I get that trashtag is a great movement and is doing great things but... This sub has turned into literal pics of trash over and over which isn't why I stay subbed to r/pics.

Again this isn't a hate comment, I think it's really cool but like can we get an r/trashtag or something where these posts can continue to live on without cluttering up r/pics.

Anyways, GG on the clean up"
"Am I the only one who sees these #trashtag posts as equal to people recording themselfs giving money to the homless ? Like if you wunna do something nice just do it ,don't have to show everyone how good you are idk I am prob just outta the loop"
Virtue signalling to the extreme
Where is Scooby-Doo?
Definitely real girlfriend pictured here
Gut gamacht.
Moin:) wo wart ihr?
"Very cool to see it's still going, it gives me hope! :)"
Danke
I love your city! Kiel Fest in the beer tent was the greatest thing ever! Nice work.
"Shawn Mendes is fuckin, everywhere."
Isn't there a famous song trying to get Pamela Anderson to come to Kiel?
"Hey, I was born in Kiel! Am American now though"
danke!
Gute arbeit
Schleswig-Holstein is fucking awesome. You are so lucky to live there. Even better that you help to keep it clean.
respect...
You're doing a great job!
‚ÄòCause that‚Äôs what hero‚Äôs do.
Sweet pic of your girlfriend
Picking trash for medals.
Thank you both for your efforts!! What a great thing to do as a couple!
"A long way from writing songs, Shawn Mendes!"
"Trashtag posts in 2029   - "" is trashtag dead yet? Here's me cleaning up the beach!"""
"I love Kiel. I have been there a few times on a Baltic cruise with the U.S. Navy. Kiel Brewery is awesome, especially during Kiel Week. Thanks for your commitment to this cause!"
I really want reddit to be known for this. And of course upvote.
" I went to buy ice cream for my three-year-old kid a few days back. Kids had thrown ice cream wrappers all around the place. I grabbed a pair of gloves and cleaned the whole place. Thank you, Reddit for the inspiration."
All it took is a picture of one really good looking person doing it to set the whole thing off even though it'd been going on for a while. As a tall white guy this probably helps but hopefully we get some model types taking photos of themselves picking up trash soon!
"Why not just do it, *without* the shameless, online humble bragging? *Downdoot*"
"Can we just make a dedicated sub? I love the trashtag challenge but it's fucking ridicolous that 80% of this sub is, literally, thrash. It's becoming extremely irritating"
his girlfriend is in the trash bags
The world needs more people like you two.
Came here for photos of the girlfriend. Left disappointed.
"Another one of these ""If I'm gonna clean up trash, I'll have to tell everyone about it because I can't do nice things without telling everyone about it."" posts. Fuck off and do something nice without telling a bunch of strangers about it."
Thanks for your work!  Every bit helps ‚ù§Ô∏è
Has multimillion dollar online drug store - cleans forests on the side. This good guy.
Is it me or have people been saying #trashtag isn't dead yet since the day started ? But good on you op. I have a trash grabber in my trunk and I'm gonna use it too.
I will never not upvote a trash tag. Nicely done!
So you are the kind of person that picks up my mcdonals trash when i throw it out of the car
Your girlfriend looks like a man
I definitely thought this was r/roastme

A good lesbian love story is always a pleasure

I will always upvote trash pickup.
Your girlfriend has a huge adam's apple.
Be careful about walking into any caves. Might end up in the 50s.

"Brooo I used to own those shoes, are they not the most comfortable shoes you‚Äôve ever worn? I‚Äôm forever chasing the high I felt slipping those bad boys on."
"This man looks good exactly like Hal Stewart from Megamind though, don't fight me on this"
"Danke, Herr Deutschmann."
The trash tag should never be dead.
"I came here to say your girlfriend looks like Napoleon Dynamite but i see i'm the eighth person to make such a joke...

Great work on disposing of the evidence. :)"

"Finally, someone has put the weapon down."
"This gives me hope in the next generation, every day I can see more and more awareness for our environment. May not be a silver bullet but if we all take small steps it make a massive difference."
"In German, #trashtag means trash day."
I got to spend some time in Kiel when I was in the navy during Kielfest. Truly a great experience and everyone was really nice! Keep up the good work!

"What sorta blows me away is that we have people who are so proud to clean up their community and post about it, though we seem unable to come to terms with the sheer gravity of how dire Global warming is. Climate scientist's around the world are having panic attacks while sounding alarm bells about how insanely bad it is. We have less than 10 years to get our world economy to a net zero(no new additional carbon) carbon emissions while creating technology that doesn;t exist to remove the carbon from the atomosphere."
You're a good man!
I love trashtag.
Adam‚Äôs apple?
Is your dad Marc Summers?
good example for people to save earth
Why aren‚Äôt people payed to do this?
Fuck you look German. Haha. Kudos on the cleaning up!
How is it that your jeans are simultaneously skinny and baggy? Please explain.
Strengthen your grip to kill #trashbag
Great job my former roommate :)
Gr√º√üe vom Schreventeich!
Yeay for both of you! Now go and get some good food to reward yourselves  :D
That's real cool. Thank you.

Thanks for destroying employment
I wish all the corporations where as productive as #trashtag people.
"I love when people say Kiel, Germany.
The only time I ever see my name when not referring to me lol. My name is Kiel and I'm half German!"
Now this is a real challenge. Kudos to you
good work
No! I am turning into ***YOUR GIRLFRIEND***
No shit dude! I'm from Chicago  IL and was just out to see my dads parents out in Kiel last summer. Loved seeing the freight boats go by. Cute little town. Cheers!
If all that came from Germany you must have cleaned 40 square miles.
"Doing things for the public good is socialism and therefore as a rule I must hate you, but I think it's a very nice thing you did."

Good on you Sir.
"Hey I work in Kiel in Wisconsin, United States!"
Andy Samberg?
I hate these hash tag things. But I love cleaning my planet.  Keep it up awesome actions dont go unnoticed for those that mean anything!
Everyone clapped
Why does every single trash tag post mention it being dead? Clearly it's not theres literally a post EVERY DAY.
Still the best challenge imo
5 tiny trash bags = 20k upvotes nice
Danke!

""Why would we do that?""                                                    ""Well, for the internet points of course."""

Oh man I haven't been back to Kiel since I spent 3 weeks in your city on an exchange program. Loved every minute of it.
Nice walking stick. Looks like a lvl 99 rare. Only obtainable by being lucky because of such a low drop rate.
Thanks dog much love

What‚Äôs with all these trash tag people having dirty posts?
German forests are an absolute nightmare. You see trash everywhere
Bravo!
Geile Nummer! Wo wart ihr genau sammeln?
"Props to you, im from Kiel too."
Kiel! Did an exchange program there in high school (I live in the states). Great place and nice work!
Danke Schone
I‚Äôll always upvote trashtag
Great job üëçüèª Well done!

"Dankesch√∂n, gute Arbeit. Ich bin in Amerika, aber ich liebe Deutschland"
"Gute Arbeit, jedes Bisschen hilft ja bekanntlich!"
"Kiel, wasn't there a naval base there in WW2?"
I will never not upvote a trasgtag post.
Your girlfriend looks like a dude bra
Cute gloves bro.
Are we going to just ignore my dude here casually carrying a FUCKING WAR SCYTHE to pick up trash?
"I don't use instagram... But we do this every time we go fishing. It fucking makes me furious that my four and six year old kids know to put trash in bags and pack it out but apparently grown adults don't. Our last trip to a new spot had me wading around pulling up trash out of the water. 

Keep picking up. Teach kids to pick up. Teach adults to pick up. And don't let someone litter without at least saying something... It's not safe to do much more sadly, but damned if we should just close our eyes to it."
"Sieht nach Gaarden aus.. Falls ja, Respekt. Wie viele Ratten sind euch √ºbern Weg gelaufen? War letztens dort im Park an der Ecke von Penny und war direkt von einer Horde Ratten umgeben. Super krass."
Thank you for your service.
"hows uncle rico been these past years, i bet he could still throw it over those mountains!"
"That's awesome, my buddies and I wake up every morning at 8 to clean up the local nature trail in our neighborhood before it gets too hot."
I'd do this in Bosnia...but most of the woodland area is rigged with mines :P
I LOVE how this movement hasn't died yet. Gut gemacht
I really want to go on a cruise to Kiel or Hamburg. They seem like nice places.
And she let your wear her gloves. She's a keeper!
So you just steal plastic from the nature? Is that even legal?!?
I wouldn't think Germans litter.  There are German towns here in Texas and you won't see any litter anywhere.
"when will this tag get its own subreddit! 

awesome man! keep it up!"

"Great Job OP! 

It was terrible in the park today. I saw a woman sitting on a bench finishing of an ice lolly on a wooden stick. Then as a walked past her I noticed there were like 10 plastic lolly wrappers and sticks all around her on the floor. She obviously had a box and shared them with some people and they just chucked all of them on the floor. She had a big wheely shopping bag with her full of stuff. Like she couldn't have just put them back in the box and put it in the bin that was literally 3m behind her or in her bag till she got home.

It's so depressing. I didn't know if i should have picked them up in front of her so she could feel guilty (probably wouldn't have done) or if i should have confronted her. I've confronted people before but they generally don't give a shit and I don't want to be that crazy person nagging strangers I don't know in the park. 

What to do?"
That‚Äôs nice you took your grandma too.
"Yeah no, that's a dude and you need to learn what a gender is."

What is #trashtag may never die
"It‚Äôs really just moving trash from one place and moving it to another. Just because it‚Äôs in a bag doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs gone from the planet. It‚Äôs just gone from one place, but it still exists and will be moved to another place, and now wrapped in plastic!"
*It‚Äôs going to happen again.*
"They're not bed bugs Dave.

(Seriously, ticks need 90% humidity or they dry out. Basically take your clothes off, check each other thouroughly for ticks, ticks love under breasts and in the inner thigh, really really check her well for ticks. You might need to use your tongue, it's more sensitive than fingertips for finding ticks.)"
"no dryers in Germany, especially not in (assuming) student's flats"
I'd like that check you for ticks
Ticks usually cannot be found that far in the north of Germany. Considering climate change and the recent hot years that may not be true anymore though
They all make a nice new pile somewhere else!
"Landfills, where at least we can (ideally) keep it out of the water supply and capture some of the GHG."
That's the question!
"I don't want be too cynical... but...

Most countries sell it to poorer countries. The cheapest companies in those countries usually. And the cheapest companies are cheap because they don't properly dispose of anything they just dump it into rivers...

So from first world rivers to second/third world rivers... Progress? Maybe."
I still don't get why people go to the forest then throw their rubbish in it instead of taking it home with them.

That is something i actually never heard
"Also check out /r/detrashed , which is the older, more established subreddit for folks interested in detrashing."
I honestly don't care about karma farming with trashtag. I will always upvote trash tag anywhere even if the initial intent was just to farm internet points (unless its a repost). No one's really getting hurt.
No one can live without bragging about it anymore
"Yeah, but reddit karma is worthless. This at the very least carries some value."
"Gut gecalled. Ist hier leider sehr verm√ºllt, aber gerade deshalb sind wir heute ausgezogen. Ratten habe ich aber keine gesehen :P"
They normally burn their undesirables.
I still don't know wtf it is and scrolled this far to see someone mention it that still didn't add anything to what it might be. It looks like a broken snow shovel.
Dicks out for German Harambe.....Ach un Harambe?
"I‚Äôm not complaining that people are cleaning up trash, but I swear I only see #trashtag posts on reddit and all of those say they think it‚Äôs ended. Is it a thing anywhere else on the internet? It feels weirdly like just a /r/pics thing"
"/r/trashtag exists, as well as /r/detrashed , which is the older, more established subreddit for folks interested in detrashing."
Its for inspiring others and spreading the message and keeping the trend going. Its not like its taking advantage of anyone as in the filming giving money to the homeless.
"Some people cleaned up some trash, other people said ""hey, that was cool of you, thanks"" by upvoting it. Everyone likes to feel like their effort is appreciated, these people are just doing it digitally.

&#x200B;

Plus, as others said below, no one is being exploited in trashtag images, whereas homeless people being filmed for donation vids can be depending on the circumstances. To me, it's a completely different thing."
Perhaps it inspires others to go out and pick up some trash.
"Nothing like that. This is a deliberate campaign that nspires people to participate  in their area and then publicize it through social media.  

The hook is guaranteed up votes, and keeps momentum up. And let's face it, even the laziest bastard can still contribute by a simple click."
"I totally dig what you're saying but for me #trashtag is all about inspiring people to do something similar. In fact, that is what brought us out today!"
"Ich wohn Gaarden-Ost, am Kroog. Leider super verm√ºllt da und wir dachten uns, wir r√§umen ein bisschen den Park auf! :)"

Just like him? Not quite. But there's definitely some resemblance. I would believe me if you told me your girlfriend was his half sister.
To be honest I genuinely thought that was why this had got front page.
That‚Äôs the first thing I thought when I saw it. Thanks for the help Peralta!
I came here to comment this hahaha
Not really. I'm not sure I'd that person is high or just needs glasses

"There is always something you can do to contribute. I am always sorting my trash and never throw anything on the ground. I know it is not as much as cleaning up places, but 0,1 is always better than 0"
I feel like you copied this sentence from google translate
"I‚Äôm an epidemiologist who speak to people diagnosed with Lyme disease and other tick-borne diseases who were certain the tick that bit them likely just hung out on their hiking clothes for days/weeks after they wore them in the woods. Or the ticks could have traveled from their clothes to their pets and then to the human snuggling them. 

Ticks are resilient and patient. That‚Äôs why we recommend it‚Äôs not a bad idea to go ahead and try to kill any that may be hanging out. Throwing the clothes in the dryer is quick and simple.

Edit: sorry, yes, we of course *also* recommend checking your body for a tick after being in tick habitats"
"This is terrible advice. Ticks tend to hide in hair, behind the knees and underarms. Sometimes in belly buttons and you can get nasty diseases if you try to use your mouth to get them off."
"I'm going to need more info on this ""there are no dryers in Germany"" statement."
What do you mean no dryers in Germany?
"That's not entirely true. Southern ticks can carry meningitis, northern ticks usually only carry Lyme disease. Source: bitten by a tick in Schleswig-Holstein before, and so have others in my family"
You put it back where you found it so someone else can get their karma too.
It's the circle of life.
"Sweden imports trash, fyi. We recycle what‚Äôs to be recycles and then burn it for energy"
"People are lazy and selfish, nothing new"
"Unfortunately that's most of what humanity is doing from an outside perspective, and is why we've spread across the earth so far."
Maybe they go to the forest *to* throw their rubbish out.
"There is definitely a resemblance, especially in the first picture that shows up when you google him. (Because I had no idea who that was) The hair not so much but the nose and eyes do look similar."
Your smile does. What the hell is that big yellow thing on the ground though?

Yea idk either man. Just pretty sure it's not a saber...
"Yeah this is exactly how I feel - like good job you are doing awesome things but this is a Reddit dedicated to pics, and seeing pics of trash is kinda... Trash. It's negatively impacting the subreddits quality IMO, even if the cause is valid."
That's true I can see that. At first I always seen these as glorifying themselves but ya their not hurtin no body and it only causes more cleaning

"I believe the issue is - you shouldn't do good deeds just because you are getting a reward.

If OP got paid $100 to clean that trash, would you still call it a good deed?  I'd assume you would not.

In this case OP's payment is Reddit karma, and everyone praising him.

A good deed is most true when you don't broadcast your actions to the world.  Pride is the deadliest of the deadly sins."

"Is that so?  For example, there are countless studies about the dangers of becoming addicted to various forms of ""social currency"".  Likes, retweets, upvotes - pick your currency.  You see these articles all the time.

Teaching society to only do good deeds when rewards are involved is inherently wrong.  Surely you see that?  When parenting children, for example, you teach them to behave properly even without buying them a toy.  You teach your dog to behave properly without always giving them a treat.

It isn't even an argument, or an opinion."

"Everyone is focused on going to area 51. But for what reason? They think that they're gonna find aliens or some other cool shit. But the truth may be what we least expect, but what we want the most. The government made the first area 51 memes about aliens so that's all we would be focused on. No no no, we shouldn't overlook what many actually be the truth. Area 51 is hiding something, and I think I know what it is. 

They are hiding the purest version of Kid Cudi humming non-stop. And the reason that this makes sense is because our army is so powerful and this is obviously where they would get there power and motivation.

TL;DR   the government doesn't want us to know that what's actually in area 51 is kid cudi humming nonstop."
Even Uncle Max got himself an alien girlfriend.
Ben 10 was the shit for me back then
We need to build Area 51 on Minecraft to practice and prepare for the attack

"I hate whenever people talk about Ben 10 on any sub other then r/Ben10, Omniverse and the Reboot get shitted on for no reason other then ""artstyle"" or ""it's just shit. Well:

Omniverse artstyle is much more expressive, detailed and better animated then UAF (Ultimate Alien Force) stiff and bland artstyle. Omniverse brought back the charm of the original series and Gwen and Kevin also came back in a episodes after Season 2. Season 5 - 8 was especially good seeing as they brought all the alternate Ben's, more aliens, kickass arcs and episodes etc. The And Then There Were None and And Then There Were Ben is probably the best Ben 10 episode. I say give it a chance. It's better then what other people say.

Also let me just say, the reboot is good too. While the animation is inferior to OS and OV (Original Series and Omniverse), it's still very expressive and shaded unlike other... recent animation shows that I won't name. Season 1 Finale introduced Vilgax back, Upgrade sacrificed himself for a new Omnitrix, a whole sick ass invasion happened, Ben went in the Omnitrix, Kevin cam back as a Albedo and Kevin hybrid. Also they brought back aliens like Rath, Humangasaur, Eyeguy and even hints of Ripjaws and Wildmutt due to an artist showing dna pods with their dna. It's getting much better. All I'll say is, skip Season 1."
"Alien Force had terrible writing and rectons.   
Animation was ok, but still a downgrade from the original."

I never liked how they changed Gwen from a cool voodoo-user with her own thing to just another alien.
La-li-lu-le-lo
Don't you hate it when you have to leave your Martian girlfriend behind...
I‚Äôm kinda shipping grandpa max and the alien chick...

grandpa is the real player
It started when an alien device did what it did
I'd like to digress. Omniverse was the best.
Alien Force starting 10 aliens sucked compared to OG starting 10. Other than that AF is better
Damn it Jerry.
he looks like gary from parks and rec in the first pic
Mass Effect
You fucking heretic. Alien force was not better than OG.
he‚Äôs kissing ben
Yes please
Ha
"What did you said?, punk."
New new ben10 is so shit honestly
But ultimate alien sucked

"Ben 10 Real Continuity Rankings (this is all my opinion, but feel free to disagree on the automod‚Äôs comment): 1. Alien Force 2. Ultimate Alien. 3. Ben 10. 4. Omniverse"
I remember when I was 7 and thinking how that was just wrong how an alien and a human was doing it
"God, i miss the old times"
No the og was the best
You will be rejected by the aliens to
Wait what episode is this
Is her vagina on her forehead?
epic
Grandpa Max destroyed more alien pussy than Commander Sheppard
Can I just forget this existing?
"I won't upvote due to the title.

You're just factually incorrect."

Out in style.

Yo imma find Ben 10‚Äôs watch in that bitch
the back oh his head is shaped like a ski slope
Big titties
burh i remember watching that scene and i freaked the fuck out
"OG was good, then Alien force went up (for me) and then after Ultimate Alien, it was downhill"
"Man the Ben10 lore was so deep. He didn't just kiss this alien, he clapped them cheeks and had 2 kids. One of which had a super powered alien/human daughter."
"Did anyone notice her forehead, or is it just me?"
max tryna get it at all costs
"If you are drunk af, it happens"
Granpaaa!
Just think of all the alien porn that will produced after this
Ben 10 was lit
He had to close his eyes
Anyone know where I can binge the original watch Ben 10? Fuck this brings me back
BEN TEN !!!!!

You lost my upvote with the title
Ah yes i see your a man of culture aswell
Alien force is good tho.
Captain Shepard approves this.
"My fucking childhood, I remember when my dad bought me an omnitrix  where I even had a minigame where I was fighting villains and had to choose the right alien. Great memories"
omniverse is decent alien force and ultimate alien are og but the original is where its at
"I saw the title, how dare you?"
"Ben Ten 2005 TheOG, The Best"

why the fuck is there an old dude kissing an alien chick."
god this show was so fucking dumb
The original Ben 10?
Ben ten
My brother and I have been rewatching all the Ben 10‚Äôs. Simpler times indeed.
IT STARTED WHEN AN ALIEN DEVICE DID WHAT IT DID
"Johnny Test, Ben 10: Alien force, whatever pokemon that was on at the time, and with my Nintendo DS and Pokemon Soul Silver. Took myself back more"
"I loved Ben 10 a lot back then. Hell, i was even 10 when i first watched it. I remember writing down all the name of the aliens on paper in school. Miss those times"
I never knew the difference and the words were mine.
It is real. Used to beat it to this scene back then

"They‚Äôre the same thing though. Like same storyline, same animation style. The only difference was the progression in the story lol"
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave.
"Wait, Eyeguy came back?!"
"Alien force seasons 1 and 2 were actually very solid, season 3 is when Cartoon Network stepped in and made changes like how ben acts, if you were to rewatch it, he is really responsible mostly for seasons 1 and 2 but then becomes a childish buffoon in season 3 and after"
ah i see that you're a ~~man of culture~~ quarian fucker aswell
Technically
The future is now old man
Yeah lmao
is omniverse part of the first og universe
Season 1 and 2 of AF has the best story telling and overall character development. Though OS is still great and is 10x better then Season 3.
"Omniverse's artstyle is much more detailed, expressive and better animated then Alien Force - Ultimate Alien (let's just say UAF). UAF's artstyle usually copy and pasted an alien design everytime an alien species showed up, it had extremely stiff animation and in one scene, they copy and pasted Ben 3 times. It look bad and not detailed. Omniverse, while weird at first, grows on you quickly. It is much more expressive, better animated, has tons of unique alien design which make them look more unique, has more detailed backgrounds etc."
For me it's: Alien Force Season 1 and 2 > Original Series > Omniverse > Ultimate Alien Season 1 > Reboot Season 2 and 3 > Alien Force Season 3 > Ultimate Alien Season 2 and 3 > Reboot Season 1
How?
For me it's: Alien Force Season 1 and 2 > Original Series > Omniverse > Ultimate Alien Season 1 > Reboot Season 2 and 3 > Alien Force Season 3 > Ultimate Alien Season 2 and 3 > Reboot Season 1
"Dude, have you been living under a rock? Hate towards Omniverse ended like 5 years ago"

Yo anyone remember Generator Rex?
that sounds like a fantastic idea
"I love all the seasons of ben 10(except the reboot). That shit was my child hood.

Edit: if you respond to me I‚Äôm almost guaranteed to respond back to you because i love talking about ben 10 XD"

It's called hentai and it's art
Are we hunting at 3 am?
I stopped watching when Omniverse premiered :( art style was too weird for me and I just lost interest cus Gwen and Kevin weren‚Äôt coming back as main characters
"I don‚Äôt think she was a hentai creature, but yeah."
They tyna be crate
They moved that stuff to Groom lake.  Area 51 isn't anything more than a glorified airfield.
"And maybe a US$60,000,000 worth jetpack project"
Also reborn
Ricardo x Max would be hot af ngl
"Bruv, you don't understand we don't have that shit yet. We have to get over first, duh."
He talking about Diamond Head.
"Which I thought got way weaker towards the latter half of Ultimate Alien. Not to mention the sole reliance on new aliens who were just carbon copies of pre-existing ones..

The first half is great though. As is pretty much all of Alien Force"
"A screenshot of I think a trailer for a new episode in Season 3 showed the Omnitrix with Eyeguy's silhouette. Though it may be just be Shock Rock with his rocks retracted (though I doubt it). Also an reboot artist showed alien dna pods (which is a thing in the reboot), which has Eyeguy, Ripjaws, Wildmutt and other dna [https://www.deviantart.com/spyder4lyfe/art/Alien-Pods-791813707](https://www.deviantart.com/spyder4lyfe/art/Alien-Pods-791813707). They might come back"
Thought so but since Alien Force happened when I was 7 wasn‚Äôt sure(ok not even 20 but holy fuck do I feel old thinking about this)
Yes it is
"Damn, you know and watch a lot of Ben 10 don't you. I stopped at ultimate alien, and as I recall it, it was fucking amazing with ultimate transformations. Just too much excitement."
Does anyone remember the shitty movie
"I want to agree with you, but I remember rewatching a few episodes after like 2 years or so, I noticed all the cheesy and forced quips. Like, holy shit, there was literally no 2 minutes without someone feeling like that have to put in a quip to whatever they were saying."
[removed]
Remember the crossover episode with Ben 10? That was my childhood right there!
"Oh man, I used to watch that a lot. Never caught how it ended though, but I've been thinking about re-watching it recently"
"I fucking love that show, didn't know the ending tho. Also , remember Megas XLR"
Yes i used to watch that. Wait anyone watched ben 10 and generator rex movie in which they both were?
The OG 2005 one is the best
There's 2 sequel series and a reboot. OG one is still the best.
SAME! That was a great show
"Hey man, I had a recent challenge with my friends the other day when I asked them ""who were the original 10 aliens Ben first had."" Wanna give it a whirl?"
"Also let me just say, the reboot is good too. While the animation is inferior to OS and OV (Original Series and Omniverse), it's still very expressive and shaded unlike other... recent animation shows that I won't name. Season 1 Finale introduced Vilgax back, Upgrade sacrificed himself for a new Omnitrix, a whole sick ass invasion happened, Ben went in the Omnitrix, Kevin cam back as a Albedo and Kevin hybrid. Also they brought back aliens like Rath, Humangasaur, Eyeguy and even hints of Ripjaws and Wildmutt due to an artist showing dna pods with their dna. It's getting much better. All I'll say is, skip Season 1."

you mean there's people who dont beat to Gramps Max?
#CHOTTO MATTE
Which one? The three year old or the four year old?
I always like Omniverse cause I feel like the show branched out a bit more. In both audience and lore.  I also liked it cause it was a little different than the other series.
"Omniverse artstyle is much more expressive, detailed and better animated then UAF (Ultimate Alien Force) stiff and bland artstyle. Omniverse brought back the charm of the original series and Gwen and Kevin also came back in a episodes after Season 2. Season 5 - 8 was especially good seeing as they brought all the alternate Ben and etc which were awesome. Give it a chance.

She wasn't. But she still creeped me out as a kid. I liked Max's other girlfriend better. The Anodite one.
They tyna be crepe
She want a meat curry
It‚Äôs still an airfield though. There could definitely be some experimental jets there.
Groom Lake is part of Area 51.
More like 60billion
"Um, I'll agree with UA Swampfire, Humangsaur, Echo Echo etc. But some of the Ultimate just reeks of unoriginality, recolours etc (like U Wildmutt, Waybig etc). But I also grew up with UA, so I will say those were hype af and were sick! Though underused sadly. 

And yeah I do. I've just loved Ben 10 since I was young. Grew up with it you know. It's an amazing but underrated franchise"
They had like 3 didn‚Äôt they
The rock version of the theme song was lit tho
"The 3D animated one? Man that was garbage. But I liked the self destruct movie, where every transformation made self destruct of omnitrix faster. It was good enough."
The live action version?
"[For reference, I'd say it didn't age well but that's giving it too much credit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGMdsWZFS4c)"
The Race Against Time? The CGI has not aged well.
I was obsessed with Ben 10 back in the days. I watched every movie and played every game about Ben 10.
Teen Titan Go! type of shit?
Eventually the show just became about selling toys which really sucks
"Havent watched ben 10 for years, any recommendation?"
I think it never ended coz show got cancelled. .unfortunately :(
God yes
"Fucking megas XLR was THE SHIT, hardly anyone ever remembers it, I was soooo bummed as a kid when it was cancelled"
Why yes. I *do* dig giant robots.
"I honestly prefer Alien Force through Ultimate Alien. 

Kid Ben got on my nerves. Wasn't a huge fan of Omniverse since Ben acts a lot more immature than he was in AF/UA, plus wasn't a fan of the artstyle."
"I agree the og is best, there are actually 3 sequels though, alien force, ultimate alien, omniverse. None of the sequels were bad but the original was still my favorite. The reboot(after omniverse) sucks"
"I still rewatch it too this day, because its honestly one of my favorite cartoons of all time"
"I know most of them:

Heat blast
Four Arms
Diamond head
Rip jaws
Gray matter
Wild mutt
Ghost freak
XLR8

After checking answers: i only missed Stink fly and upgrade

Good challenge mate"
"I might check it out, thanks for telling me!"

I hope they do. Same goes for Heart gold. I had tons on fun trading/battling with my friend who had it.
"If the trend with remakes keeps up, the next games will be Diamond/Pearl remakes. Hopefully they'll let us have all the Pokemon then though. Not buying another Pokemon game until I can bring everyone though."

"Thanks for the summary, I didn‚Äôt even know they had 8 seasons of omniverse. I might give it a watch. I just don‚Äôt get why the ultimatrix doesn‚Äôt make the cut in there, maybe I‚Äôm forgetting something. Idk I just really liked Alien Force and ultimate alien, had some good stories, characters, arcs, and world building (except for the last season of ultimate alien with the big octopus, that shit was trash)."

"I spent my 7th and 8th years of life watching it. Ultimate Alien episode after Ultimate Alien episode. I hardly knew English back then so I didn't have any idea about what's going on with the storyline. I just knew all the alien names. I loved when Humungosaur transformed, as did every kid, and when that spider like alien transformed. It just used to be fun. I didn't care about anything else. I just loved watching aliens transform and kick ass."
"3 movies or 3 aliens? Either way, you're right"
The rock cover of the theme actually slaps

"Like not as bad as Power Puff Girl reboot, but yeah like TTG"
I would say worse
One of the aliens is a rip off from alien force so ya
"Not that bad, but teen titans was a less mature show than Ben 10 in the first place."
Tbh that‚Äôs what most shows are about. Young justice shut down just because it wasn‚Äôt pushing enough merchandise
Start from the original and continue with 3 next sequels
"Nah, it didn't get cancelled. What happens is Providence is usurped by Black Knight, female emo girl, and she and some of the Higher-Ups get super powered up using the Original Nanites (can't remember the actual name) that are basically Nanites that can control the laws of nature, time, space, anti-matter, gravity, etc. They begin hunting down Evos and the Resistance teams up with Van Kleiss gang, until the latter gets captured (Circe as well but not before sharing a final kiss with Rex). Rex learns how to control his powers more (if you missed out, he can create more weapons and can even dual wield different ones at the same time) and unlocks a sort of Megazord form. He does battle with the Providence baddies, who can also Megazord, defeats them and gains control of the Original Nanites. Baddies are able to escape with some of their powers intact but Rex gains the physical ON which he uses to cure EVERY Evo on Earth before permanently deactivating them so no one can use it again. The show ends with Rex talking with Bobo Haha on how though there aren't anymore Evos, there are still baddies (shows guy in a mechanized kangaroo suit, I think) and Read saying hell be there to kick their butts or something cheesy like that."
"Omniverse artstyle is much more expressive, detailed and better animated then UAF (Ultimate Alien Force) stiff and bland artstyle. Omniverse brought back the charm of the original series and Gwen and Kevin also came back in a episodes after Season 2. Season 5 - 8 was especially good seeing as they brought all the alternate Ben and etc which were awesome. Give it a chance."
It was so dumb because omniverse ends with an obvious hook for a sequel series. A road trip across the cosmos? That sounds awesome. But no we have to reboot it because apparently kids wont watch a show that has continuity
"I didn‚Äôt like omniverse, I also wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the art style. The new one is just straight up trash now"

This type of comment needs to die.
"Ultimatrix was an unfinished, broken mess that wasn't great. Ben just had to use it due to the OG Omnitrix being exploded. Even then the OG Omnitrix was a prototype. The new one has more modes, a better ai etc.

Also I agree, especially AF Season 1 and 2. Though Season 3 of AF, due to executive meddling, was fucked with an episodic shit storyline with only a few good episodes and an asshole Ben which made sense (due to fame and all that), but still was unbearable.

UA Season 1 brought back the same charm as AF Season 1 and 2 but more lighter, and I love it. Should've been expanded more and less rushed (with the whole Ultimate Kevin thing). UA Season 2 went back to the episodic thing, had good episodes. And Season 3 was largely boring with a few good episodes."
Imma gonna fuk dees hoes
"Secret of the Omnitrix (was a fantastic ending to OS) and Destroy All Aliens were good. Race Against Time and Alien Swarm... yeah not the best, nostalgic though"
"Also let me just say, the reboot is good too.

"What‚Äôre you on about Teen Titans had a girl being groomed by an evil mercenary to be as close to a child soldier and sex slave as a kids show would allow, a physically and mentally abusive father-daughter relationship, PTSD, and more"
"I've watched all of it. I still don't like the artstyle or how Ben acts.

The animation is better, the artstyle is worse."
"Which is crazy because we live in a time where shows that tell an overarching story should be the clear best. With streaming sites becoming the norm and ""binge culture"" being the way people watch shows youd think writers would take the chance to tell more complicated stories.

Then again, CN is pretty horrible when it comes to figuring out what the market wants out of good cartoons so oh well."
"I agree, Cartoon Network has a history of mistreating their shows. And this can even be seen throughout The ben 10 shows. Cartoon Network makes random changes in the show just because they wanna sell merchandise or  wanna reach a larger audience. Cartoon Network is also the reason why pretty much every show spot is dedicated to Teen Titans Go."
Its fine that you dont like omniverse or its art style. And i agree the reboot is straight up just a shameful and stupid. The series is aimed towards 3 year olds who dont even give a damn about the show or what it had been.

They need to be lined up and shot.
"This reminds me of a big news story a few years ago where some scout leaders pushed over a rock formation in goblin valley, Utah in front of their group."
So they ruined the ruins?
"If I were God I would do something like:

They left it in ruins
I hope they got yelled at.
ISIS does this. So I can actually say without exaggerating: they're as bad as ISIS.
This shit gets me really pissed
This pisses me off almost as much as those idiot fuckers who burned the Library of Alexandria.
Wish these types of people would die instantaneously when doing dumb shit like this.
"i mean, they're already ruined."
Someone please ruin these ruiners for this ruination.
all that for a drop of clout?
They must have motive
 Chimping out
God knows when these kids will stop being shit heads
I hoped those guys stub their toenails
Kill them with fire

"speak up anytime you see destructive behavior. Many people like destroying, and its hard to speak up, but civilized people must."
I always have trouble upvoting these kind of posts because I forget that the OP things they are a total piece of shit as well
So true :/
**THEY RUINED IT**
"The English, the French and much of Europe have a few hundred years head start on these guys."
Well its nice to know kids are stupid all around the world.
"**Ignorant**

It's okay to give them the death penalty. Nobody will speak against it.
why are people so dumb that they post videos of there crimes on the internet?????
Death penalty
No public whipping or chopping off the dick?  Sad
"These types of people should be imprisoned for 50 years, minimum sentence."
I hear the Indian prisons are real bad this time of year

"oh my god man, wtf?!"
Can‚Äôt they be charged for vandalizing? That‚Äôs terrible
How is it that natural disasters and high winds havent done this already?
So sad
So those pillar things were just sitting there without being anchored to anything? How have they lasted this long if all it takes is pushing them over?
Someone should just beat the shit out of these kids.
Yeah! Fuck you ancestors! Your legacy will be forgotten
It was already ruined
"My Hindi is pretty shit, but I think the text basically says ""When will these kids grow up? God knows."""
This hurts my soul.
What is wrong with people?!?!?
Imagine believing you'll be remembered for destroying something made by someone who actually did leave a mark on the world. What a losers
"Noob question here, do ancient ruins normally not have any security? 

Can anyone just walk up to these ruins and do as they please with no security there?"
No better than those ISIS fuckers. Destroying culture and history.

"Im sorry, this is awful behaviour and all but

Would you say they RUIN-ED those structures?"
They should be beaten to death.
Incredible India. This type of disregard for the rest of humanity is what justifies the death penalty (IMHO).
Now they‚Äôre ruined ruins.
You could say they‚Äôre... ‚Äòruined‚Äô *slips shades on*
I cant believe they only got fined 980$. They are wrecking peices of history.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs already ruined so let me ruin it more‚Äù that‚Äôs his completely flawed logic.
This makes me want to vomit
fuck these people honestly. they go around boasting how they destroy something that has more significance then them and think its all cool and shit.
Great fucking idea to film it and incriminate yourselves
I‚Äôm not a violent person but this video makes me want to assault those people. I genuinely think this is a valid reason to use physical force.
I'd love to spit some beechnut in that dude's eye

Whoever built it should have glued that down or something.

I would watch the video of them fixing it.
"Maybe the extent of the damage wasn‚Äôt too bad, but a $1000 fine seems pretty small for vandalizing the ruins."
"‚ÄúI was an ancient prank, bro!‚Äù"

"These ruins were once part of Hampi, a city in the Vijaynagara Empire, from the 7-8th centuries. They're very treasured in the history of India. What these POS did is unfathomable."
Idiots don't think like that. To idiots that kinda thinking IS idiot thinking.
"Too be fair, watching the video of them doing it, not much happened other than the top popped off, so kudos to the brilliant architects who made them in the first place.  Luckily for those vandals, they were only fined, and made to put them back into place.  But that would be some fucking AWESOME payback, if the entire thing shattered, and they were made prisoners until they had carved a replacement that perfectly resembled the originals."
It's the same mentality that makes tweens being little shits to any adult around them. They have felt powerless their whole life for one reason or another and now realize they can do something stupid that gets a reaction out of people and they suddenly feel powerful.

Yes they are caught... See the top comment
"They were caught, fined $1,000 and then forced to fix the damages they caused."
"to feel powerful

When anything of significance is left unprotected, people will try to destroy it"
"Saw a reddit thread where destructive behavior is discussed. Couldn't trace it, but here is what I remember from it.

At a certain point in a person's life, he/she will want to come to the thought of ""what am I in this world? how can I leave my mark?"". Usually this happens in teen/early adult stage.

The ideal answer to that question is to be someone who ""creates"". Build a career, or a company, make art, music, make an impact by advocating for other people's welfare, or saving the environment. No matter how big or small the act, doing or creating something significant satisfies the existential question for oneself.

However, some people think that they cannot ""create"" for various reasons. Reasons such as having a low self-image, or still haven't found their passion, and the like. 

Instead of creating, they turn to destructive behavior. Destroying something, for them, feels like they have made a mark in the world. It's empowering in a twisted way for these people."
Some men just want to watch the world burn.

"This is definitely a very shitty thing to do or encourage but the death penalty is a bit much for this especially for a teenager who's still in the midst of brain development. They definitely should face some jail time or they could go on that show where they take teenage gang members to Americas most hardcore prisons and put them in their place. 

Yes the people on this sub deserve justice but to wish death upon them makes you no better than the offenders. This penalty should be reserved strictly for serial killers/rapists/child rapists."

In India that's a pretty hefty sum of money
"India‚Äôs per capita income was [$1,670](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_in_India#Financial_Year_2015-2016) in 2016 so probably was appropriate unless their parents were very wealthy."
"That‚Äôs like 60% of the average income per year in India. Think about paying 60% of the average income per year in America.

They‚Äôd be fined much more than 1K if that happened in America."
"It's $1,000 each, 4 of them arrested. So $4,000 in fines, which as someone else said, is a lot in India"
"In India $1000 is like 60k-70k rupees last time i checked. and to give you an idea a 4 star restaurant in India costs 500-1000 rupees a person, so you can eat 70-120 decent meals times with $1000 dollars"
"This isn't America. 1000 dollars there would be around 40,000 dollars in America."
There was what amounted to a $5 fine for smoking between the train cars while I was there. Everyone smoked.
Scum of the earth like this should get prison sentences
It doesn't work like that lmao

"It's not the 7th and 8th century. The Vijayanagar empire was established in 1336, and declined after a defeat in 1565. Hampi was the largest and wealthiest city in India in 1500, and the second largest city in the world. It was pillaged for months after the empire lost to the Deccan Sultanate in 1565, and was abandoned soon after."
"That‚Äôs great that it wasn‚Äôt completely destroyed, but I‚Äôm wondering why an ancient pillar that has made it through hundreds of years of wind (and who knows what else) is so easily knocked over by a few teenagers anyway."
"Actually no as they were arrested, forced to pay a fine and re-erect the pillars with the help of some workers

"That's a shit ton of money to those teenagers in India, I can guarantee that"
"The GDP per capita in India is around $2100. 1000 is 47.6% of their per capita. For reference, the GDP per capita in the US is around $55,000, so $1000 for them is roughly $26,180 for people in America."
They‚Äôre from India so it‚Äôs probably a lot for them
"I did some googles and I found that even the middle class Indians only make on average 13k USD a year which means even a 980 dollar fine would be a big hit for that, but guessing by the age they are likely the lower class and make only 500-2k a year."
Average income in India for '17-'18 was INR 113000 ($1655). So the fine would be ~62% of a person's yearly income.

"Angkor Wat is a fab example of conservation, but only because teams approach it with great care. Japan and Germany is at the forefront of it. It‚Äôs easy to fuck up 600 year old sites, sad thing though it‚Äôs not possible to later unfuck them. When it‚Äôs done it‚Äôs done. (By this I mean: some part of the stone will be ruined by the use of wrong materials and it cannot be repaired only replaced, and that is then classed as restoration, not conservation. Conservation only applies to the original material)

Some temples are gradually being reclaimed by the jungle because there are not enough professionals of this type (stone conservators) in the world, and this complex of more than 300 temples can only claim so many people... However, this stone has been lying there for 300-500 years, it can wait for a decent professional to approach it when the time comes."

"Assuming weekends off, that's a years wage right there. That isn't a small deal at all."

Not really. You just saw the video of how they treat old things. Some Indian kids will push you over and post the video onto social media.

Probably one of the low-end shitters given the quality of the video. You can get a TracFone LG Rebel for $30 on Amazon.
"Cheap knockoffs or older smartphones. A mid range smartphone in India is around 9,000 rupees, or a little over $130 US."
A smart phone that records in potato quality is like $50 in India. That's like if you own a $500 in America.
"smartphones are dirt cheap. Less than $100 for a ""good"" one, $25 to $50 for a passable one, and they all have cameras. It's no longer a luxury item, it's basically a necessity. It's just people who want big fancy screens and next gen processors that pay $1000."
The first iPhone came out 12 years ago. Most people have had 4-6 phones since then and there have been 10 generations of Samsung Galaxies. It's pretty reasonable to be able to pick up a used phone for like $20.

Because then you have to live in India. 

My church friend got a kush gig working for a company in China (yes, not India, but the problems are similar), making well over six figures a year plus expenses in exchange for being fluent in both English and Mandarin and negotiating with Chinese vendors for raw materials (typically steel and rare earths). 

He gets paid pretty fucking good money, but according to him it was ""probably the worst decision [he] ever made"" because he is now a permanent foreigner. Every day, he is either worshiped, hated, or marked as a target for exploitation just for being American. His quality of life is pretty good - but only if he stays in the ""Western"" areas. Otherwise, it doesn't matter that he speaks Mandarin like a local, he is immediately an ""other"" wherever he goes, and gets harassed by locals and by cops alike wondering what a ""tourist"" is doing there. He's followed in and kicked out of stores, and he constantly listens to people shit-talk him in Mandarin just because they think he can't understand them, while being talked down to in negotiations because they think they can use their language to pull a fast one on him, using slang, ambiguous language, or hyper-technical terms to try and deceive him when interacting with him and take him for everything he's worth. If it's not that, then they're treating him like royalty and going ridiculously out of their way to kowtow to his every whim, or trying to nickle and dime him for every possible penny he's got on him in all manner of creative ways they think a ""tourist"" won't know.

Yeah, he gets paid a LOT of money (like in a few more years he'll be able to return to the US and have a nice nest egg to get a more family-oriented job) but he has to constantly be on his toes all the time in a way that is absolutely exhausting, where even little things like ""ordering dinner"" can be an absolute pain in the ass just because he's a foreigner.

This is slightly complicated by the fact that he's also black, so the racism is even worse than back home in Texas. He told me that while there were parts of Texas he felt like he didn't belong - and a rare few places he was even scared - he at least always had places he could go where he did belong, or places which were at least ""neutral."" Where he's at, he makes more money that he knows what to do with, but he is either stuck being a ""Westerner"" in a glorified compound (in his words, ""forced to act like a white guy"" among the Americans and Europeans there), or he's a complete outcast who is immediately hated or worshiped by the locals.

For many people, the money isn't worth dealing with all of this, unless you're planning to go, make your money, then retire back home where you actually like it."

"There's problems with these companies where ever you go. Idk how the laws work there but even in America, in Maine, there's an imminent domain law that's basically: if you can get to it, it's yours. So companies can pump whatever they want how much they want as long as they have enough land to build a pump and they don't have to pay anybody to do it. It's basically a 100% profit after the pump and labor to run it.

Well this has been happening fot years. People only noticed now. I read about it when doing research for uni. In parts of Africa many babies died as the mothers tried to strech the formula for more meals by adding more water and thinning it out. Loggically this makes no sense from a business stand point as surely they would promote them spending more on nestle rather than stretching it thin. I think the real problem comes from inadequate mothers not caring for their children with natural breast milk. Especially in these poor countries.

"The CEO of Nestle once said, with his own words, ""Water is not a human right.""

"Well there's approximately 6 quadrillion gallons in the great lakes. At a pump rate of 400 gallons per minute per Nestle as is their legal contract with the state of Michigan of how much they can pump from their well, at 525,600 minutes in a year, that is 210,000,000 gallons a year. So 6 quadrillion divided by 210 million they would need to pump for 28,571,428 years to drain the lakes. 

The problem is not the drainage. Its that Nestle literally paid a one time $5,000 permit fee and an annual $200 (yes $200 pumping fee). That's not a typo or a joke. Nestle past $200 a year to pump water from the great lakes. Its the fact that at about $4 for a 32 pack they make their money back after selling just 25 32-packs. You think they sell a little more than 25 right? Well they sold $325 million worth of water JUST in Michigan. Part of a $7.7 billion fiscal year. Which they pay virtually nothing for their product beyond distribution and marketing and bottling. And do the residents get anything for their government selling 9ut their people? Nope. Not a single God damn dime. 

So in turn... fuck Nestle."

BULLSHIT. Here is the clip, start at 2:04:

https://youtu.be/oR_KXZZc13U

He says (when discussing if we should privatize water) that it's an extreme position to say that people should have a right to water, a position that NGOs take, and that he thinks water should be treated like any other foodstuff. That it should have value, as in not be free, and *if people can't afford it* we have to work something out for *those people* and there are several different options there. He definitely does say that it's an extreme position to claim that anyone as a human should have a right to water.

He's a backpeddling asshole because of bad PR.

Edit: omg the moron goes on to bash the 35h workweek while saying we have to work more to create more jobs. The it cuts to him asking why people are so mopey when we're richer than we've ever been (thinking of himself, clearly), then he brags about an highly automated Nescafe factory in asia and how it has almost no people working there. Look at all those jobs he created huh. What a prick."

"Yeah, the city of Evart owns the wells (Nestle paid for) and charges Nestle only about $2.30 per 1000 gallons (municipal rate) which they pump out every 2-3 minutes. However the town and surrounding community is one of the poorest in the state and Nestle is continually trying to buy the city out by paying to repair roads and updating baseball/softball fields. Evart is for all intents and purposes owned by Nestle as the aquifer it sits on is the only thing that could draw any big business.

"I may be wrong, but I assume it‚Äôs got to do with Lake Michigan (and the other great lakes that are near it)"
We‚Äôre the largest concentration of fresh water in North America if I‚Äôm not mistaken
"Michigan is the land of a thousand lakes, and it's all fresh water, so yeh there is a lot of water"
We have alot of aquifers here.  Many springs just flow day and night and you can get your water free
Michigan has like 90%of the world available fresh water supply or something crazy. California had the idea of running a pipe line there when the weather was really dry a few years back.
The Great Lakes which make up a large chunk of the entire world‚Äôs fresh water
We have the largest freshwater lakes in the world
"Although we‚Äôre surrounded by the Great Lakes (being by far one of the planets largest sources of accessible fresh water) that‚Äôs not directly where these companies take the water from.  There‚Äôs an enormous amount of water in the underground aquifers in Michigan and lake levels don‚Äôt directly correlate with water table levels although they are a factor.  So messed up to think Flint, MI still doesn‚Äôt have drinkable water (4+ years) in this land where companies make billions off of the clean fresh water and we‚Äôre surrounded by the stuff..."
Michigan native here. There is no point in the state of Michigan where you are farther than 6 miles from a body of water. The Great Lakes are our pride and joy (even though they don‚Äôt get treated well at all)
"Huge amounts of fresh water. For example, Lake Superior is the largest freshwater lake in the world. Michigan has more water than most other places in the world. I'm not sure if Nestle drains directly from the Great Lakes or not, but there's still plenty f other large lakes to drain from"
Michigan homie here. Michigan has most of the freshwater in the world from the great lakes but Flint hasn't had clean water in 5 years.
"There is a lot of water here, but more importantly we have many streams and rivers as well as aquafiers that lead into the great lakes. These streams and rivers are where many companies like to pump their bottled water from."
"
Its the most fresh water in the world. It‚Äôs almost all of the world‚Äôs fresh water (drinkable, unlike the ocean)."
There is more freshwater around Michigan than anywhere else in the world.
Flint Michigan
"It‚Äôs a really tricky thing in reality. It‚Äôs nowhere near as simple as we like to think. It‚Äôs the classic ‚Äúwe‚Äôre poor so we have to sell our only resource until we run out but we are gonna run out of money either way so we might as well sell our water but we need water but we need money but we need water more but we need money to pay to pump the water anyway so we have to sell some water and save some but we don‚Äôt have..........‚Äù  I tried to make it as circular as possible because that‚Äôs how it actually works in reality! Everybody needs a lot of different things and the city can‚Äôt afford it so they have to compromise but the scales of compromise get tipped when the city runs out of leverage and everybody is screwed anyway. There are hundreds of steel towns across America that used to be booming industrial centers of the world but the the steel industry changed and relocated everything and now these hundreds of cities like Flint, MI and Youngstown, OH are now basically ghost town craters with crazy high unemployment. Is it fair? Well it sucks but I mean if a singular person learned how to type write in the 70s and refused to learn technology in the 2000s and lost their job that‚Äôs just called unemployment. That‚Äôs just the way the world goes sometimes. But when it happens to entire cities and counties and even states then things get really weird and morality starts to change because the practical applications of your ideals don‚Äôt seem sustainable."
I‚Äôm pretty libertarian so I‚Äôm aware of the big heaping bowl of salt you might need to listen to my opinions but I honestly think that if the city was so poor that they needed to sell their water for so cheap then they would have been bankrupt either way. They just delayed bankruptcy by like 20 years by selling their water at a loss. It sucks but there just isn‚Äôt enough money to subsidize every single city across America with the current budget and that should probably change. But I honestly think it‚Äôs similar to a poor family with no education being forced to sell everything they have to survive. If a construction worker is starving he has to sell his tools to eat. But if he has no tools he won‚Äôt make any more money anyway thus guaranteeing the next meal being even harder to find. That sucks. We sure don‚Äôt know how to prevent poverty cycles like this on individual scales and we definitely don‚Äôt know how to prevent poverty cycles on city-sides bases either
"First the context: In this part of the video they‚Äôre not talking about drinking water specifically but about who should pay for the infrastructure for getting water necessary for survival out to everyone. In developing nations some will use that infrastructure to water lawns and fill their pools, while someone down the block will use it for survival. The idea is that if you attribute a monetary value to water instead of saying it‚Äôs a human right you can charge a premium for the people using it for non essential things, and have that finance the infrastructure for those unable to pay for it (that‚Äôs one of the possibilities he‚Äôs referencing in the last sentences).  In that context he says:   

‚ÄúWater is, of course, the most important raw material we have today in the world. It‚Äôs a question of whether we should privatize the normal water supply for the population. And there are two different opinions on the matter. The one opinion, which I think is extreme, is represented by the NGOs, who bang on about declaring water a public right. That means that as a human being you should have a right to water. That‚Äôs an extreme solution. The other view says that water is a foodstuff like any other, and like any other foodstuff it should have a market value. Personally, I believe it‚Äôs better to give a foodstuff a value so that we‚Äôre all aware it has its price, and then that one should take specific measures for the part of the population that has no access to this water, and there are many different possibilities there.‚Äù  


And this is his clarification:  ‚ÄúLet me be very clear about this again here on the blog, because I think the video clip, which took my views out of context, isn‚Äôt clear about the point I was trying to make.  The water you need for survival is a human right, and must be made available to everyone, wherever they are, even if they cannot afford to pay for it.‚Äù"

Bad logic, I know, but where I live - rural upper Michigan - what you‚Äôre talking about is super common as well, never thought about it as a solution for a metro area myself?! The problem all started when the state government changed Flints water source to save a few bucks and the old infrastructure leeched lead into the water among other things (you can find many videos of discolored water) - kicker was the government could have fixed it relatively cheap had they been proactive - the whole thing was super corrupt (govt offices being ordered not to use the tap water, many upper level communications circulated and ignored)...

"I‚Äôm about to show some real ignorance here, but how does that not have a noticeable draining effect? If millions of gallons are getting pulled before they feed into the lake isn‚Äôt that causing the water level to slowly go down?

I‚Äôm from a literal desert so I don‚Äôt really know how noticeable these things are."
"Ah ok I was wandering if they were draining the great lakes, because its actually illegal to drain the lakes and sell the water somewhere else besides the state's and provinces touching them"
"Yeah, i mean, walk a bit in nearly any direction and you‚Äôll find a lake, anywhere you are in canada"
Are you IN Michigan?

Excuse me
"Water levels have gone down, especially in the areas where Nestle is pumping!! They are literally not leaving enough water for the fish. 

AJ+ made a great video that outlines *some* of the damage they‚Äôve done. Note that this is from over a year ago so this problem has undoubtedly worsened since.

To top it all off, a large portion Michiganders don‚Äôt even know this is going on in their own backyards. And for some, it‚Äôs actually happening in their backyards.

FOR THE 189
"Well there's approximately 6 quadrillion gallons in the great lakes. At a pump rate of 400 gallons per minute per Nestle as is their legal contract with the state of Michigan of how much they can pump from their well, at 525,600 minutes in a year, that is 210,000,000 gallons a year. So 6 quadrillion divided by 210 million they would need to pump for 28,571,428 years to drain the lakes. 

The problem is not the drainage. Its that Nestle literally paid a one time $5,000 permit fee and an annual $200 (yes $200 pumping fee). That's not a typo or a joke. Nestle pays $200 a year to pump water from the great lakes. Its the fact that at about $4 for a 32 pack they make their money back after selling just 25 32-packs. You think they sell a little more than 25 right? Well they sold $325 million worth of water JUST in Michigan. Part of a $7.7 billion fiscal year. Which they pay virtually nothing for their product beyond distribution and marketing and bottling. And do the residents get anything for their government selling out their people? Nope. Not a single God damn dime. 

So in turn... fuck Nestle."
"Usually it does, lake Michigan's water levels have been on the decline in recent years (although the argument is being made that it has a history of varying highs and lows which I won't deny). The variations are only within a couple of feet usually, so it really isn't all that noticeable. Until, this year, in which we have had large periods of rain that has caused the water levels to rise to record levels, and flooded many beaches along the coast. In short flooding seems to be more noticeable for people and therefore, the draining of these springs isn't a problem for many."
True story. I live just off a massive fuckoff bay.
Thank you. Though now I think of them all as geese.

Wow. Fuck Nestle.
Imagine how flint feels. Can‚Äôt even get clean water yet nestle pumps it for practically free -_- really makes you wonder if Michigan‚Äôs politicians are getting kickbacks from nestle cuz it makes zero financial sense. Guessing they‚Äôd justify it by saying if they raised rates nestle would leave. Boohoo. Pumps are machines. Bottling is done by machine how many people does nestle actually employ in Michigan?
"In a lot of ways, we are."
Then they will lose the money and their life.
"Guys, just use go to the Nether, make the right calculations for distance, and then make a portal inside the Nether so that you will come out inside of Area 51! And they can't get rid of the portal unless they have diamond pickaxes, but even then, it will take them too long to mine!"
But then the aliens won't spawn either :(
"Sir, Yes Sir!"
Put them on the spawners
"Also guys, remember...... Don't sleep in area 51"
"I‚Äôm in the UK, so I can‚Äôt attend. But I‚Äôll mine some extra coal and send it over via an Ender Chest."
Im pretty sure we're the mobs
And break all of the gaurd spawners.
"Make sure not to break the spawner, we can use it to help the aliens exp grind"
"thanks! update me on how it goes btw, im canadian."
Good idea!
Unless it's like a Blaze Spawner in which case you're screwed lol
"Stupid question, but do redstone torches have the same effect?"
"Come on Guys, we just need to Gamemode c"
We need to find the guard spawners first!
"If we find a spawner, we can farm the guards for EXP and enchant our diamond swords"
"Nah that won't work, you gotta take out the guard spawners."
what if they spawn the wither
Don't forget the beds and armor...and yeah bring em elytras too
Stacking up on coal and sticks rn..we need more coal boys
oh no oh fuck guard sieges ignore light levels
don't forget to build dirt huts too.
"Place a bed too. If you get shot by the guards, you will respawn in Area 51."
Are we killing the guards now?
200 IQ play!
Or just go in creative mode
Guys we need to raid area 52 that‚Äôs where they‚Äôre really keeping the aliens Area 51 is just a cover
At this point it‚Äôs like r/Minecraft and r/memes just merged you know?
We could also slab the area if we run out of coal
Get the creepers to blow up their base
"Day 20, I infiltrated the weebs, they are planing to take dangeous stuff to area51 but we are prepared, our catgirls have been training and are ready to put down any Naruto runing weebs, I will watch out for more informations- FBI agent 69"
Guys that wont work they work similar to pillagers so torches won't work we need to slab the area
How much tnt we got
and sleep to set your spawn point
Ok so first of all how do you make torches that big bruh also yall big gas better prepare the nital we might start the DR.STONE petrification
Guys why dont we just play in peaceful mode? Or fight them during the day?
But we‚Äôre the Pillagers
Outsanding move
How come this doesn't have more upvotes
What if they have a command block there? ü§î
Oof
But you forgot the underground parts. They can still spawn there then move up to the surface.
r/Minecraft
Also bring a lead and some fences so your horses don't run away. Don't want a j√ºrgen situation going down. And I will set up a bath water stand for y'all thirsty gamers
"Bruh, just destroy their beds"
F
"And extra wood and pearlwood walls, just for saftey"
I like this one
"Their spawn is determined by sight, not light"
finally a good fucking area 51 meme
we should break the spawner as well
"I thought Area 51 memes were dying but as always, Minecraft saved it"
Shout out to the legends who are bringing lava buckets.
Get some totems if undying while you‚Äôre at it
Remember to put keep inventory on
"Pretty sure they use the beds there, destroy those"
I'm doing my duty as a Candian Citizen and upvoting
Are these memes going to last until September?
"Can somebody explain to me the whole ""51 area"" thing?"
Who collecting the alien poop
Remember to pack instant health potions
Lol nice
Useful tips 101
Lets win this guys.
Don‚Äôt forget your large army of dogs either
IQ 200
It will also stop other mobs like skeletons and zombies from spawning
"No don't place torches on the ground in the desert, the floating sand will collapse and you'll die of fall damage in a hidden ravine."
/time set 0
Break their beds too
And put it on normal mode because easy mode is hardest mode somehow
Me in 2020 after they stormed area 51: this goes against Rule 10....
remember to play cave scary sounds when guards are nearby
Guards: **switches to pig spawning code**
What about glowstone
"Damn, I'm out of sticks rn"
aye aye captain
We should make a gaurd farm
What's with the Area 51 memes lately?
"Dude, just use this command:

/kill @e[type=!player]"
Lvl 21 guards in the Varrock castle courtyard amirite?
And sea lanterns
Sooo much to choose from
Bruh just switch to creative mode
Looks for aliens finds herobrian
You ever thought that we are the real mobs?
And don't forget some swiftness potions for the Naruto runners
üçâ for all the aliens that died in area 51
"Thanks man, nearly forgot about those (:"
"Just me or dose area 51 look like fort Zancudo in this pic?  


Edit: Reworded it"
"You're getting it wrong. This is a PvP raid, not a PvMob raid. You have to destroy the guards's beds so they respawn far away"
What do they drop if we turn them into a farm? Anything useful?
Fucking died to this meme
You humans will never make it through NNYYYEEEEEEEEE
Just turn on peaceful mode smh didn‚Äôt want to do it or say it but seems like the only way
Great idea
Wait! Is that how torches work in Minecraft? Am I the only schmuck who just found out about this?
Haha
facts
Area 51 uses... Supercharged Creepers
What if the guards have special spawn properties?
GUYS WHO STOLE ALL THE COAL AND STICKS FROM THE CHEST???
Guys find the spawner
Don't forget your tactical insertions as well
Nice tip
Shiee I forgot
SAFETY TORCH \*ba na ba na ba na ba\*
Nah dude just destroy the spawners
Guys make sure to bring your beds and sleep at the same time so the guards burn in the sunlight
This is getting ridiculous. How do I join
Lol military tactical planning hours before attack
But how will we deal with the Gards?
And maybe lead the aliens
Bruh this area 51 stuff half the people are going to show up being nerds with there hand creme and glasses with a little kid bag i feel bad for there mom who has to drop them off
But then the guess will be spawning like crazy in one place
whack
How did all of this area 51 stuff start?
"directly destroy the guard spawners, they don't need darkness to spawn in the nether"
How do you know we aren‚Äôt the mobs
Guys we must be smart the FBI agents are still watching us and are reporting this to the area 51 agents!
Make sure to bring your loyalty tridents
"Why don‚Äôt we just use Ender Pearls instead the nether, or both"
Lol
"Where we droppin, boys?

^(Oh crud, wrong place!)"
The raid will simply not work as you guys have given the military a month to gather their warships and oversee your plans of attacks. Foolish.
Someone should play \*insert soviet song here\* when the 300k people charge at Area 51
And remember to sleep so that no f-14s spawn.
LMAO
And remember to not destroy the spawn because you need to farm it for mobs and exp.
YOU CANNOT SLEEP THERE ARE GUARDS NEARBY
Outstanding move
Just go to sleep
Alteration 100
But aren‚Äôt we the raiders?
Also we need to place beds so we can respawn. We will need it
Flawless plan
Ahhh yes what we needed a area 51 AND Minecraft meme
Lol that doesn't work anymore in version 1.420
thats the best area 51 meme i saw lol
"What if I told you,area 51 walls,are made of guard spawners"
"/give @a glowstone 128

There we go. Make sure to put it in the ground and ceiling so it looks nice!"
But then the aliens wont spawn either :(
Nice now its like playing on peaceful
When is the raid?
Pls stop with area 51 memes.making it impossible to visit Reddit.its been taken too far.
Stop area 51 memes its still too early for the event  so save them near the events time
Why does this low effort garbage have 24k upvotes
BAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
"Sh it meme, but still upvoted"
"Maybe it will burn all the fat, smelly nerds ruining the internet! ‚òπÔ∏èüòû"
"You just earned yourself a promotion, soldier."
But what if they have efficiency 5 pic. and a haste 3 beacon?
"The nether is inside Area 51
Wait the nether .....
So you‚Äôre saying we should all kill our selves ?"
water bucket: observe
"Gather in the remote island of [redacted] and someone calculate the distance to Area 51 and calculate the distance necessary to arrive inside.  
We will infiltrate the alien prison get some advanced tech and get out, we must destroy the nether portals to destroy the evidence."
But they can put it out!
But you can break it with water or lava -.-
They have an area 51 inside the nether too.
Water buckets tho?
Maybe we can use tnt to distract them
The aliens are attracted to light
The aliens are already present
But the aliens will have already spawned so it‚Äôs all good
Guys. Just don‚Äôt put torches near their nest spawners. Fucking duh
The technology will still be there
Thermal cameras can detect your position. You can't hide from the AC130
You must construct additional pylons
Any other orders captain?
"then, later we can set up a farm :D"
"There are too many enemies nearby anyway, so we can't"
But they can‚Äôt access your Ender Chest.
"Your a good man, soldier"
Shulker Boxes*
Yeah the guards are gonna be the ones placing the torches
"Nah, we should turn them into a farm"
They probably have a command block somewhere in there.
Good idea
We hope it doesn‚Äôt come to that
"Aye soldier, a j√∂rgen situation would be fatal."
bruh üëåüòúüëåüòúüî•üî•

Blasphemy! We are the mighty warriors of this server!

Yes. Poop.
Nonsense. We have the men and the weapons and a damn good war plan.
"Thanks for the recon, soldier. Keep us updated"
WE NEED SUPPLIES
Craft torches and weapons and armor and anything else u may need
Weapons
"Yes, but they underestimate us. No one truly knows the full power of a whole jar of vita gummies. Not even them"
"Not the attitude we need, soldier"
"We must prepare, soldier"
area 51. try it
"You keep on posting discouraging comments on each post. Grow up, if other people enjoy stuff theres no need to hate. Nobody here likes people like you at all. Get friends and then share opinions with them"
I don't think you want to see where the existing portal will drop you...
*_oh boi_*
you can make haste 3 beacons? I thought it only goes to buffs level 2 / 2 level 1 buffs. alien technology I guess.
"No, man, just make a portal. Obsidian and flintstone."
Sir yes sir i will keep the girls in the kitchen
*...lamp*
Put Beacon down. I will bring my diamond blocks.
Rest up. The big day awaits.
Don't forget your diamond sword!
Place beds so you respawn when killed
I wonder what their drops are! Maybe they drop guns!!
"And even if we could, it would explode"
He‚Äôll just make a flying machine with chests on it

I already have a human farm in my basement

"I cant find any trees in the nether so it'll have to wait, unless.... you have some?"
That means there's gonna be a boss guard we have to defeat before we get any loot
So I just show up
Thanks for the downvote kind stranger!
"Ignore this guy, I'm pretty sure he's just mentally ill. Some of his comments don't even make sense"
"Also, happy cake day"
Shut up scum
Oh snap yeah they might have a portal trap set up to burn you in lava if you try to portal in.
"No. 10 lava buckets, water, and flint steel."
I‚Äôll try not to bleed all over them.
Mothra confirmed
"Aye, sir!"
when exactly we doing this?
With bane of arthropods enchant to kill the mutant spiders
And don't forget your bows and arrows
Why didn't I think of that! Great idea!
You can‚Äôt push chests
I do. I have two stacks. Here
We have the men to defeat this boss
Yes
No u. You aren't even worth using an Uno Reverse Card on.
No just make ten obsidian generators and a flint and steel
Tis but a scratch
September 20th
dont forget to set /gamerule keepinventory
He‚Äôll use the bedrock version
"Thanks, have some iron in return"
Is there a materials starter pack
"to be honest he aint worth a reply, leave the internet scum alone and they will go away if they dont get their daily internet attention"
Wait you can make obsidian generators?
Your arm's off
Roger that .
You better get rid of those spawners too!
Or just use chests in minecarts
"Thank you, soldier"
No. We need to go mine and chop wood
Yeah just have a water source flow into lava and it makes obsidian
I‚Äôve had worse.
"Be ready, soldier"
Np üëå
Since when?
"Come on, you pansy!"
It‚Äôs been in the game since I think beta
"For all of the years I played Minecraft and experimented with lava and water (especially on Skyblock) since 1.2.5 Java, NEVER have I seen a obsidian generator."

"If anyone wants to feel better I'm having a pretty fun time right now at 29!

Edit:

I spent ages 12 to 26 suicidally depressed. In a way, depression and suicidal thoughts become your comfort zone. I'm prone to depression genetically and most of my school years were spent being bullied. 

At 26 I almost tried to kill myself. It was the closest I'd gotten. I visited my therapist in an emergency appointment and she took one look at me and said ""you call someone in front of me to keep you safe or I call 911"". So I went to my hometown and stayed with my dad for a bit. 

3.5 years later, therapy and having been on meds for 3.5 years (Venlafaxine [Effexor] 150 and Bupropion [Wellbutrin] 150), I'm in a good spot. I had a spot of drug addiction last year which I highly recommend, but I climbed out because FUCK going down that path after working so hard to leave depression.

Now I'm pretty confident with my abilities, eating healthy again and trying lose weight I gained with the addiction, and I've quit smoking. The confidence I SHOULD have is here, and should only get better. I have an insanely wide net of friends that makes me feel so loved that I can't believe I ever felt that way before. 

Hope this helps."

The problem there is that is humans are really good at putting our pets out of their misery when their quality of life just isn't there anymore but we don't extend that same mercy to our human family. We can't even make that choice for ourselves in most countries and in the ones where you can there are often stupid rules in place to make sure you don't get what you want. In my own country you can make provisions to be euthanized when you lose your mental capacities but you can't just say that you want the once and be done with it. You have to yearly formalize that statement or it is no longer legal...

You have a skill that's in demand. Don't let anyone tell you that you don't. Chances are, the people who don't think it's valuable are the ones who would never be able to do it. I hope you don't have to do CS now, because it's awful, but... if you are, I hope you're well-paid.

Where do you buy it?
How would somebody go about seeing this?  VR?  Through their phones?
More please.
Some people in this thread seem to not be understanding what‚Äôs happening here. Augmented reality as it exists now (through the camera of your phone) is just 3d objects anchored to real surfaces. In this case the 3d object is simply anchored (and mapped so it covers the whole surface) of that book.
This is why I want computerised contact lenses. It's going to get real cool.
someone probably spent just as much time on the AR book cover as the author did on the book

"Cant wait for Aug reality to really break through be it glasses contacts or implants it will have a huge effect on our existence. Imagine information about everything you are seeing as you need it a true level playing field when it comes to the shared collective knowledge of mankind. Or just the living room, right now most living rooms and even bedrooms are arranged around the TV have to put all the seating tables even your bed in the right place to have a good viewing angle... with augmented tech you wont even need a TV just open a window in your field of vision set it as big as you want and as opaque as you want and drag it to where you want it. With everyone able to have there own view you can arrange rooms around conversation or just to actually fit the space instead of the view of the television."

Is the book any good?
"Yes, that is interesting as fuck.
I love it, god damn awesome!"

"I just did the JFK AR things on my OnePlus 7 Pro.

I cant wait for future AR! Sorry, VR, your the HD DVD and AR is BluRay. Just die plz!"
I'm judging this book by it's beautiful cover
Hey I made an app that does this!
Wow. That‚Äôs literally amazing.
r/unexpecteddetroit
Of course it's an Ayahuasca book. üòú
just wait til they play those 15 second unskippable ads on the cover every time it recognizes that someone is looking at it
Im ready to start living in AR permanently
How the fuck
Living in vr is gonna be sick!
Ownership is slipping.
Gallifrey falls. No more.
Immediately thought of Detroit: Become Human

"It‚Äôs cool, but I‚Äôd be hesitant to even read a book like that.  Literally judging a book by its cover here, but the great classics never need a flashy cover to hook in readers."
What a really *really* neat idea.
I want my coffee table to look like that
Plot twist: It‚Äôs actually a portal
Take. All. My. Money.

Any chance I could get the QR code? I would like to hang it as a framed picture on my wall. Would be a conversation starter!

"Welp, I guess we're fully in Minority Report now."
Does anyone know the program used to make this?
"Yeah right, this is a magazine from Detroit become human"
One step closer to Diamond Age
How does it work?
"Very nice, but I wonder how much more the book has to cost for a cover like that."
Uh. How thi
"Wow, who knew that AR could be used for such a thing?"
I'd be interested to know how it was printed.
Am I the only one googling it right away?
"I got it after the first 5 seconds and the video just kept going and going. I thought we were gonna see some interesting pages within the book itself. Or at least the back cover. Nope.

Cool cover though."
"Wait how is this augmented reality? It‚Äôs not like the cover is changing by what‚Äôs in reality. It‚Äôs a really, really cool 3D book cover but I didn‚Äôt see any change depending on what happens in reality. I thought AR was supplementing what happens in real life, like a heads-up-display in a video game, whereas VR is just completely making up a new vision of reality, like the video game itself. If anything wouldn‚Äôt this be better called a VR cover because it‚Äôs its own field of vision/view? I don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs augmenting reality but if I‚Äôm just whooshing on something someone please explain"
"I AM LOVE

   ^^^^^Nothing ^^^^^happened"
"so whats the point of this? It seems to be exactly like standard printed holograms that we've had on books for decades.

But this 'hologram' requires a phone to see? Seems inferior to regular holograms."
All I see is someone trying desperately to sell books.
*wack*
That would be..... challenging on LSD.
Bruh what the actual fuck? How?
*How?*
Where can I learn to make something like this?
I concur that this is a *cool* cover
"You can. That saying originated before books had decorative or protective covers. The cover used to contain the first page of actual text because it was easier and cheaper to produce, so the authors would plead for people to not judge their story too early, and to give it a chance to get going.

The absence of actual covers actually really played a huge role in story structure as writing for entertainment or study grew in popularity. The reason authors put the endings to their story on the last page for example: it prevented it from being spoiled by accident.

Other neat things about coverless books is that none of them lasted very long - either falling victim to the feared paper mushrooms or book worms, they no longer exist but their lasting effect on the placement of a story‚Äôs ending remains today."
Now I am afraid that the cover may be cooler than the book in this case.
"Never judge a book by its cover.  How many times do we need to teach you this lesson, old man?"
Book is going to sell way more than it would with a plain cover. Many people will just buy it for the cover.
The book is ironically terrible.
You get a one time pass just for this occasion
You can‚Äôt judge the whole book but you can judge the cover
"Why not just say ""wow that's a cool cover"" and not ""wow that's a cool book because of its cover""."
I want to watch whatever movie is made about this book.
"I'm probably in the minority here, but I personally think it's fair to at least judge a book's first impressions on the cover. I mean, it is what we were taught for a decade and a half in school and I do it, even though I never consciously think about doing it (and I'm sure many others do).

Again, I do accept that I'm in the minority for this, but hooking a reader with first impressions is a wise thing to do and I've enjoyed most of the lesser-known books I've read that have cool or intriguing covers personally."
You can judge the cover by the cover. But no judging whole books. That's rude.
I would buy the book and and not even read it ...
And they'll all look like page after page of QR codes in the store.

It's only through an AR camera app.
Timelord art; it's bigger on the inside.
"There are several AR glasses available. They just exist as development kits that *nothing* is every made for. 

The Hololens and Magic Leap are really cool, but there's nothing you can actually do with them, after being available for a long time. It's crazy."
"Because it's a really hard problem to solve.

A list of things you need for AR:

* Location information.

In order to do proper 3d rendering, you need to know where the ""camera"" is. In the case of VR and AR, you need to know where the camera is, with roughly millimeter precision, around 90 times per second. This is doable with external trackers, but you don't have those with AR. It's *just barely* doable with *internal* trackers, as long as you can cover your faceplate with cameras and include a reasonably large amount of visual processing horsepower on board, and even then it's not great; expect this to take a few years to be viable.

* Occlusion data/depth data.

A lot of our visual cues are based on what goes in front of things and what goes behind things. In order to make this work properly, we need to know roughly how far away things are. This is doable with a *lot* of processing time; it may soon be possible with things like [time-of-flight cameras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-flight_camera). But we're still working on getting those available at the price points needed for this sort of application.

* Realtime and fast 3d rendering.

First-person VR/AR requires 90fps, more or less. Just doing this, at all, takes a bunch of 3d rendering power; making it look good takes more. This is, again, *just barely possible* with modern technology - see the Oculus Quest - but it wasn't possible even two years ago.

* Compositing.

This is a hard one. We can make opaque screens with external cameras that reproject the outside world, but then you look like a weird gargoyle. We can make transparent screens with internal one-way light emitters - see the Hololens - but then it's not possible to show shadows, or show dark things on light backgrounds (the same problem that projector TVs run into.)

In theory we could use an LCD backing to selectively block light, then an LED layer to emit light. But that's a lot of tech in a small package and nobody's gone to the trouble of making it work.

* Form factor.

Finally, all of the above, and it has to run for an entire day without a recharge, and be the size of glasses, and not require that you carry a backpack worth of computer hardware and batteries around.

I guarantee people are working on this, and as you can see from the above list, there are people working on *every single part* of this. Honestly, the people I've talked to in the VR industry generally agree that VR is a dead technology walking, and that everything they're working on is aimed at eventually getting AR . . .

. . . but we've got a long way to go for AR."
"Just this year a couple companies have developed 1080p+ screens from 0.3-0.8 inches diagonally. These microleds are made on wafers which allow for the extremely small size. The size will. Allow for very small form factor and comfortable high Def AR glasses

These are being sold to manufacturers this year. So I would expect a good jump in quality of AR glasses to be out in 1-2 years

Edit: jbd and plessey are two companies making these screens if you'd like to research them."
We do! Check out Microsoft Hololens! It's awesome!
Apple is 100% developing AR glasses that will use their ARKit technology. Will probably be years away though.
You use your phone and it changes it. Like Pok√©mon GO
"It's to justify buying a book when you don't really read, but love showing all your friends the latest in unneccessary technology anytime  you can."
"6 years ago I was getting a graduate degree in something business related and took a consulting class.

Businesses would reach out to the school for free consulting from students.

One of them was a failing publisher that historically made coffee table books, shortlist articles, etc., that have been replaced with phones.

This sort of thing was exactly my suggestion. Don't compete with phones, make them add value to your product. They were acquired as a wholely owned subsidiary whose parent company already developed applications with similar capabilities. 

My favorite suggestion, however, was for them to expand their ""memory"" book area. They did stuff like yearbook and event publishing. We look at yearbooks for nostalgia, which would only be enhanced with digital media pulling popular news and entertainment from that year."

"AR combines a few pieces of tech you've probably seen quite a bit. First is just some 3d visuals. Same as any video game. Next is image recognition. This app is probably trained to recognize one and only one image and that's the book cover. When the camera sees the book cover, it crops it from the image and replaces with a view of the 3d visual that is designed to look like the book cover image. It would work just as well if you had a picture of the book on a screen and pointed this app at it."

Also its $88
That's insanely disappointing. What a waste.
"I suspected this! I recommend trying to connect to your spiritual side. I‚Äôm an athiest.. or ex-athiest? I don‚Äôt really have a religion so idk what I am, but I recently got into yoga and psychs and I can say that it is the most positive thing I have done for my life and mental health ever.

Not into drugs? Atleast try yoga, meditation or some form of mindfulness. Remember these are skills so in the beginning you won‚Äôt get much from them. 
/r/yoga /r/meditation can get you started (also the kindest subs on the website!).

The headspace app you see advertised everywhere is actually legit and has a free course, do 5 mins a day of that for a week and you will notice a difference in your mindset. Please! you only have one life, try everything to make it as good as possible. you can delete the app after youve learnt the basics.

Want to have a psychedelic experience without drugs. Try holotropic breathing. its basically just breathing in and out fast so you get excess oxygen in your body and brain. do your own research on this as it can be dangerous, generally its safe though. just dont do it in water or if you have a history of seizure.
this breathing technique is a surefire way to get a really quick preview of what mindfulness does for you long term. 10 minutes of this and after you will feel like ultra supa zen. 30-60 minutes and it could be lifechanging.

I challenge any athiest to genually try some of this stuff and challenge their own beliefs. Mindfulness is not religious but can be very spititual, that is not a bad thing at all. We have no hard science to understand our consciousness, so if you want to find your own conclusions, start exploring the only consciousness you know how to explore, your own. its very rewarding 

We are in a mental health crisis right now and i genually believe this is the way out. i read that some schools were replacing detention with mindfulness practice.. dude that is the solution 100%"

Not VR but AR (augmented reality). Involves the real world with added digital effects. You only see the digital effects through your phone screen.
We‚Äôre like 40 years away from tech like that.
It's the ayahuasca kicking in.
"Kinda lame when you need to hold your phone up to see it.

"Look up Unity and Vuforia, you can make similar things at home with your phone camera with no coding knowledge! :) It isn't very difficult to learn and see the basics - I used to teach students who'd never touched a programming language how to do this."
"Look up ""augmented reality"". It's in the title."
That's intriguing
"I just looked it up.

Fuck"
Download Unity and look up some very basic tutorials for Vuforia. It doesn't require any coding knowledge really and is quite easy to jump into so that you can at least understand how the technology functions.

"The tech used in this video has been around a while. It was made using Facebook's Spark AR platform, which has been publicly available since May 2017. The target tracking feature this is using was made public about six months to a year ago. This is currently accessible in all versions of the Facebook app on Android and iOS."

......wow......
"It's printed normally, the AR effect is viewed through the Facebook app on a smartphone, and was created using Facebook's Spark AR platform. The cover art is tagged/inserted as a ""Target Image"" which the camera looks for and tracks."
"it's literally just a flat picture the same as any book cover. An app recognises the cover as something called a 'marker' then overlays the 3D information through the camera - in this case an image with lots of depth, but you can also make 3D characters walk around and stuff.

It's actually very easy to set up and you can have a go at home using Unity and Vuforia, with 0 coding knowledge."
Augmented reality is simply placing visuals over reality. You can see this kind of tech by using Snapchat or the 3DS QR Cards.

"I'm disappointed to know that that's the truth, but it couldn't work any other way to that level of detail and color"
"Which is sad. If more things were made for them, at least rich people might start buying them. With more people buying them, the price might go down allowing a wider audience to buy it, giving incentive for more things to be made for it and so on and so forth up to a point.

But if that doesn't happen, they are really cool looking novelties."
"I remember seeing something about the future of AR like 4 years ago. One of the ideas was that you‚Äôd be in a city and be able to look down the street with your glasses, and see live directions to your destination. On the way there might be markers that pop up in front of local businesses that you could focus on to open the their website, reviews, etc."
I thought the hololens wasn't commercially available
"We have these dev kits and more in our office. Visuals are still extremely underwhelming. Not sharp or bright and the killer is the small field of view. That and no one can think of a single useful thing to do that isn't a gimmick. Phone-based AR is much more accessible and high-fidelity but it's also been flailing for a while. Word Lens felt like a miracle but no one has really topped it in the last 8 years. Pokemon Go is a nifty gimmick. This book cover thing is cool, but it's probably fun for like 60 seconds and you'll never do it again."
Someone's been trying to develop Yugioh on the Holo Lens for a few years now. They had an impressive number of 3-D models last I checked.
"ML1 has apps, it's just kinda sparse.

The MadeFire app on ML1 is pretty cool, it's for AR enabled comics and other graphic novels.  I have wasted hours reading stuff on there."
"Wow! Thank you for such an extensive explanation. I love VR, but agree with the people you mentioned who said AR is the future. I don‚Äôt know if I agree VR is *dead* considering it‚Äôs not even completely lived yet, but AR has practical advantages and potential for greater adaptation.

I didn‚Äôt realize how much it took technologically, since I remember google Cardboard (I know it‚Äôs a light VR experience) but imagined all you‚Äôd have to do is combine that with the image from the phone‚Äôs camera and depth information. But there is more that goes into AR than I thought originally."
"really informative, do you work in the field?"
">form factor 

There‚Äôs other reasons why VR isn‚Äôt setting the world on fire, other reasons why 3D TVs and google glass got abandoned, and among them is - looking like a huge nerd when you use them. Owning a 3D tv was cool and all and I like my VR headset, but I can‚Äôt help but say I feel a bit like a dork using them in front of people, like being naked or something. Google tried its best by hiring models to wear Glass in public and encouraged early adopters to wear them all the time, an effort to make them normal and even stylish, all to no avail. Wearing tech on your face is kinda tricky to get away with, even some headphones look kinda awkward. 

AR headsets are cool and all and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be a thing but I have doubts it‚Äôll ever become widespread. Phones, wearables (like watches), or perhaps a HUD in your windshield feel like more likely (and fashionably cool) places for AR to take off."
"> the people I've talked to in the VR industry generally agree that VR is a dead technology walking

Could you expand please?"
Awesome. Will they be transparent or just standard screens?
They just announced that they scrapped the project
"And will cost twice as much as any other equal technology, be touted as Better Than Anything ever made no matter what, even though you've had yours for years now, your friends will never admit you have something cool, and will only be usable with Apple's store provided items."

Says the guy who's clearly never tried a psychadelic
[deleted]
"Hey! Thanks for the thought out response. I actually am pretty into a lot of spiritual stuff, like meditation, prayer, spiritual reading, and my favorite form of exercise is yoga because of the sheer amount of awareness I gain of my body through it. Though, when it comes to psychedelics, other drugs, or even alcohol, I tend to stay away from them. While I do drink sometimes in social situations, I guess I've never really liked the idea of consuming a substance that manipulates your state of mind. I'm sure there are a lot of people who have used psychedelics or holotropic breathing and gotten really eye-opening results though, so it could be interesting to experience it in a safe space, like in a group session or retreat with instructors to help guide you.

Still, I do think I probably prefer more traditional meditation. I've heard that meditating for longish periods of time can put you in a similar frame of mind (albeit, maybe not as intense). Either way, I do really enjoy it, and I like that I never really lose a state of relative control. It is really soothing and I constantly feel like I'm discovering something new, even if I start off with the same thought or phrase everyday."

You could put the ending inside a random bathroom stall and put a map at the end of the book.
"He's lying, but it's a successful lie partly because starting with the end of the plot, then going back, got popular relatively recently in story telling, it wasn't popular centuries ago."
"Right. I don‚Äôt think anyone questioned why the ending is, you know... at the end? Would also be interested to know the alternative. I know you can mix it up by having a teaser of the ending as the opening but still."
"I think /u/guywithrealfacts may, in fact, be lying. Hard to say, though, because his name implies he knows what he‚Äôs talking about."
No questions allowed! u/guywithrealfacts must surely know what he's talking about with all these real facts and all.

Now we need this at a much much higher resolution and size so we can use it as a TV/movie theatre.

"> I don‚Äôt know if I agree VR is dead considering it‚Äôs not even completely lived yet, but AR has practical advantages and potential for greater adaptation.

It's worth keeping in mind that VR is basically a subset of AR; any fully-capable AR system will double as a VR system. I completely agree that the VR *experience* is not a dead-end, but VR-only devices probably are, in the ultimate long term."
"I work in game development, have a few friends who work in VR, have interviewed at a few VR/AR places, and did a brief stint in an unrelated sensor-heavy field. I'm about as close to working in the field as you can get without actually working in the field :)"
"> AR headsets are cool and all and I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be a thing but I have doubts it‚Äôll ever become widespread. Phones, wearables (like watches), or perhaps a HUD in your windshield feel like more likely (and fashionably cool) places for AR to take off.

In the Shadowrun universe (which has proven weirdly good at predicting the future), AR linkages are usually done through glasses, contacts, retinal implants, or straight-up optic nerve implants. I completely agree that this is the way things are going - the absolute height of geekiness that I can imagine being popular would be [something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yaFqM_v1JM).

And obviously we've got a *long* way to go for AR to be viable even in glasses form, to say nothing of the others."
"The tl;dr is that VR is just too awkward and bulky to be anything more than a niche toy. AR, on the other hand, is a gamechanger on the same level as the smartphone, and once (not if) it's compacted down into a form factor that people are willing to casually use, it'll hit near-100% saturation in first-world countries.

Meanwhile, a working AR solution *is* a seamless working VR solution, so once that AR device exists, even the hardcore gamers will just switch over to it.

But it might take a decade or two for that to happen, and there's going to be a lot of weird wonky geeky AR systems between now and then, analogous to the suitcase-sized satellite phone (only strapped to your face instead.)"
So the screens themselves will be solid but the current tech is the light is projected/transferred to a heads up display. The screens are extremely bright for this reason

"His personal opinion about yoga and the foo foo woo woo arts has lead him to make this declarative statement. He‚Äôs is absolute in his gut feeling and he wishes to express in no uncertain terms that a concept that hasn‚Äôt resonated with him is a waste. And it must be so, because he feels that way."
"Not who you asked but i believe it's from the ""spiritually awaken"" shtick. Which is, depending on who you ask, bs."
This seems a lot more extreme than most psychedelics.  Recently I thought Midsommar had a fantastic portrayal of how subtle most psychedelics actually are.
I feel that those swirling videos you stare at for 60 seconds that make your vision trippy are extremely similar to tripping. But psychedelics effect everyone differently.
No sorry. Your best bet is to follow individual fields (like AR or VR) that you're interested in to get the latest and greatest news from them. I use Feedly to get my news from the Tech publishers. It's quite useful.

"I played with this type of stuff about 5 years ago when AR first hit with a lot of hype on a platform called Aurasma (acquired by HP now). Pitch concept for a professional sports team season ticket wow.

There were several cool ways to integrate elements, like a simple 3D model via .obj or Unity package. 

But one of the cool things is you could acheive and effect similar to this was with layered art, staggered in z-depth which worked with the AR vision to create a very nice parallax like shown in the OP.

AR has gotten much better over the years with tech, quality, hardwear specs, and some OEM/OS dev kits.

Adoption is hard because of true usefulness and default integration/support in consumer devices (QR codes are still a bit iffy but much more usable now that default camera apps have scanners integrated vs having to download a specific app for such s niche thing).

I‚Äôd love to see more useful ideas and easier consumption of AR."
Because it's augmenting the reality of the book cover. The cover isn't actually a beautiful galaxy looking holographic image. It's just a giant QR code.

Did you not see /u/WoodenBottle s post above? It is a static scene but it looks amazing basically the same as OP with no AR

Sure there‚Äôs ways to get past the ‚Äúnot cool‚Äù factor and we very well might get there, but a lot of this stuff ends up dead in the water when the initial product fails to be commercially successful. 

Another part of the issue with Glass was the ‚Äúwhat the hell is this thing for‚Äù question. There was this belief that a post-smartphone world was just a tech product away and a rush to invent that device. But you know what‚Äôs similar to having a screen floating in front of your face at all times? Holding one in your hand via your phone. 

Problem is products like Glass or the coming Hololens or whatever else are only iterative improvements in a narrow selection of features and downright drawbacks in most others. How do you control this thing? With your phone or some other external device that your already now having to look at? 

Again, the future is cool and all and probably filled with AR, I just don‚Äôt think we have much idea what that will be like and have doubts about personal HUDs."

So what you are saying is Snow Crash needs a new cover.

In fairness, people have been saying that about VR since the Virtual Boy. Significant technologies have a way of un-dead'ing themselves if the demand exists.

> How do you control this thing? With your phone or some other external device that your already now having to look at?

If we're talking full inside-out tracking with object recognition . . . well, your hands are objects, right? So, gesture control. Or use the AR screen projected on the back of your wrist.

Possibly subvocals or even a brain-computer interface, depending on how long it takes us to get the sensor package, rendering, and output tech working."

It was virtual In name only. 3D monochrome, stationary Boy just doesn‚Äôt have the same ringtone it. Virtual Boy set back VR by decades, no one made another commercial VR product for decades . It‚Äôs my point exactly - commercial viability is key and VR is struggling still, despite years of incubation and development.

"This is actually harder than it looks. Water is very dense and fluid drag is much more than air drag, pulling yourself out of water with that kind of a weight is immensely hard! 

Some aquatic animals like sharks, actually have specialised skin morphology which allows them to reduce water drag significantly. In fact, this design is partially responsible for the inspiration of wing tips in aircraft. In addition, shark skin swimming suits were also were popular until they were banned because of this advantage."

"Just got back from San Juan Is, Washington.  Did the whale watching tour.  Guide was able to follow a pod of orcas trapping dolphin(s).  Didn‚Äôt expect to see orcas feeding on dolphins.  I grew up loving dolphins.  Oh well."

This is how I want to die.  Crushed by a breaching whale while swimming in the ocean.
Do these whales just jump for fun?
Show-off
"Amazing! Do you know where this was? Edit to say - when I lived on Orcas island, some people just did NOT want to go kayaking out of fear of getting eaten by an orca. How fucking metal would that be, though? I kayaked constantly after that. 

&#x200B;

TAKE ME, FINNED SEA ASSASSIN."
Lit
This might be the first time I see an orca that isn't in slow-motion.
"The crazy thing to me is that you occassionally see great white sharks breaching while going after seals, they rarely get their entire body out of the water.

Orcas, who are way bigger, just casually throw themselves almost the length of their bodies clear of the water and then gracefully reenter. They have better hang time than an Olympic high jumper for crying out loud."
Very cute

I could teach that whale to jump out of its tail
Wait killer whales in fresh water? Oh hell no
Ehhhh the ones at Sea World do this all the time.
No
"Unfortunately, due to their migration patterns there aren‚Äôt a lot of regular sightings in the same place. I‚Äôve vacationed in the region every summer of my life and even with summer being the peak sighting season I‚Äôve only ever seen them once off that coast. While that is anecdotal, someone in our community probably sees them once a year at best off the coast. Since it‚Äôs a huge area and the whales can cover something like 100 miles a day it becomes tricky. But when it does it is pretty spectacular! As a side note, the whale watching industry is obviously huge there (I‚Äôm pretty sure this is in the PNW) and while the captains are pretty good about maintaining the regulatory distance from the actual whales, other boats will often follow them to see the whales and then get way too close to the poor animals. A dangerous situation all around and has always bothered me. Probably more than you wanted to know but just some context!"
"As nature intended. Screw you, Sea World."
"As someone who lives in the PNW and often travels by boat around Vancouver Island...yes, I can imagine."
Was just wondering who owns the cottages in the background. Imagine sitting on the dock in a muskoka chair with a cold beer and watching the orcas play. What a dream!
"I used to live near a place like that, but we had jumping mullet instead of orcas."
"Grew up in a place like this, witnessed this stuff literally all the time. Had no appreciation for it whatsoever until I had moved away, and went back for a visit."
"I lived in Bamfield for a while working on their coast guard station. Very isolated village off the west coast of Vancouver island, saw orcas fairly frequently but never jumping like this! Anyone know where this was taken?"
"Looks like fox island in resurrection bay near Seward Alaska, I believe there is a lodge there"
"Yup, and it never gets old."
My first thought too.
"Look up Cetacea Lab. Janie and Hermann do that as their full time job (whale watch half the year) on Gil Island, northern bc :D. They‚Äôve been there for 17 years now (I think)."
"You take it for granted, I grew up in a place like this and it just felt like normal stuff, they would cross within throwing range of my bedroom window, and the birds were noisy as hell."
You mean when they come seasonally all the time?
I live near Sea World. Can‚Äôt see it anymore.
That‚Äôs a good imagine right there.
"Can you imagine how good that Orca feels actually catching the timer on his camera perfectly? 

Lucky bastard."
"To be honest, I'd be impressed the first few times."
My exact thoughts.
Alaska
Sa la na a yuum iasis
Yes because they're my favorite animal.
"The native tribes did, until they got slaughtered by invaders."
I‚Äôm proud to say I‚Äôm moving there tomorrow and couldn‚Äôt be more excited (for a promotion)
I know someone who was sitting on a dock with their dog and an orca leaped out of the water grabbed the dog and swam away
like working at SeaWorld
"We scattered my grandmother‚Äôs ashes off a boat off the coast of BC and a whole pod of orcas showed up - babies, big bulls- they came 6 feet away from us and ushered her into the next world. It was very special."
It‚Äôs spectacular when you finally do! Went to Alaska for research and saw a family of orcas. Was told we were extremely lucky because a group that size was rare in that part of the sound.
Went canoeing on the ocean once and an orca pod rose up from the bottom and almost flipped me over. Then they started circling me and making big waves. Scared the shit outta me I had to quickly paddle back to shore lol. Beautiful amazing creatures though!
"When I was about 14, travelling the south coast of Tasmania with family and seeing this huge orca fin peirce through the water. Was an epic sight!"
"Blackfish really opened a lot of eyes.  I‚Äôm taking my family on a kayaking tour next week and Orcas are the goal!  (San Juan island, Washington) Wish us luck- I think it‚Äôs going to be amazing"
"The San Juan Islands, Washington have a resident pod, and a whale watching park where you can see them"
"I've seen lots of them on trips up to the Pudget sound. 

You can see the pretty far south, but if you want to improve your chances, head north."
One of the busiest ferries here in Seattle stopped in the middle of Elliot Bay (the main body of water next to downtown Seattle) because there was a pod of Orcas.
"Come to Victoria BC, we have resident orcas here year round."
"If you take a trip to the PNW there are many whale watching tours that guarantee sightings. I highly recommend it over looking on your own, all of the tour companies communicate with each other on sightings so they pretty regularly know where the pods will be. I believe most have above a 95% sighting rate (some even boast a 100% sighting rate)."
I once saw some spyhopping watching me hike along the beach early in the morning. They are fascinating creatures!
Come to New Zealand. I went on a dolphin spotting trip in Tauranga and got to actually touch a full grown wild orca as it swam around our boat with its buddy. It‚Äôs was life changing.
Get to Vancouver.  Then drive to the main BC Ferry route between Vanvouver and Victoria.  In Active Pass you can often stop pods from the deck of the ferry.  It‚Äôs a cool perspective as you‚Äôre so high above the water (50‚Äô?).  Then go on a whale watching zodiac (or bigger boat) tour out of Victoria‚Äôs Inner Harbour.  Enjoy.
these death machines are so cuteee
"Same I‚Äôm getting a tattoo of one. Funnily enough they are the only thing I like about this shit state, aka WA, no disrespect to Seattle."
"They are actually not an animal, they breathe oxygen through a blowhole on the top of their heads so they are actually mammals."
This is so bad its good
MEDIORCRE!
This is so flipping adorable.
It looks like it! I was thinking San Juan Islands
"We followed T65A's pod yesterday out of Friday Harbor, San Jaun Island. No spectacular jumps like this one, but a stubborn teenage Male T65A2 was wondering away from his mom and freestyling a bit."
Is it? I'm making a bucket list
"Whenever I see video of whales or orcas breaching, that's all I can think about. Especially large whales, the amount of power they're able to push out in order to get that far out of the water is insane."
"In real life they are much, much larger than on your screen but to be fair so is the water they propel themselves out of."
Scary panda dolphin
Or wondering what‚Äôs down there that scared that out of the water
"I often wonder what the reaction was the first time Europeans saw animals or locations for the first time when they were exploring parts of the world. Like, with a local guide and then boom Polar Bear eating a seal, or Orca breaching."
Avatar the Last Airbender kinda [ruined orcas for me](https://static1.fjcdn.com/comments/Personally+i+dont+think+theyre+spirits+_d00e45b0f9f72a8bd3e67e5cd16c9746.png). I find their appearance slightly terrifying..

Keiko was such a [sad story](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keiko_(killer_whale)). I got to see him when he was in Oregon in ‚Äò96 and he looked so miserable. They did eventually release him into the wild but he had a lot of trouble with the transition and died a year after he was released.

Sometimes. But they also do it for orientation and scouting purposes. There is evidence that the sounds generated from breaching activities like this are also used for communication.
But aren't the orcas there all residents? Ie they only eat Chinook?

There hasn't been one single human death cause by wild orcas in recorded history.
"I guess you can train it to drive an M1 Abrams, but it'll probably take some time. Smaller tanks are not recomended, as they might not be able to accomondate a large orca."
There isn‚Äôt a tank massive enough to properly simulate the open ocean.
Yes!  They will eventually curl their dorsal fin as a sign of affection.
Actually there is no record of a wild Orca attacking a human. It‚Äôs probably safer with Orca‚Äôs around because the sharks would leave.
"What? No. There are estimated 50,000 in the wild. 

Source: https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/killer-whale"
"Approximately 4000-5000 off the coast of North America as of last year's survey - general consensus suggests at least 50,000 world wide with about half in Antarctic waters, so cheer up! :)

Source: ran a boat conducting marine mammal surveys for the Kitimat LNG pipeline and kept in touch with the scientists.

Also wikipedia to confirm just so I don't look the fool."
Fair enough
"I agree with you. That looks like Port Renfrew, which is on Vancouver Island, in Canada. It is about 2 hours away from anything, and there are signs to check your gas. It‚Äôs beautiful though."
Alternatively yes
Read with squidward's voice
Just loop the video a lot. That‚Äôs how it would look living there. You didn‚Äôt try to imagine at all. You just gave up.
"I used to live in Victoria and go on stand by whale watching this fairly often.  Although some boats do try to approach the whales, they are considered dicks by the other guides and the companies are regularly reported. 

That being said, we would usually see a pod and turn off the engine and wait - often the whales will approach the boat, swim underneath it etc. They are pretty curious. I think they like to hear the collective ""ohhhh"" when a 5 foot dorsal fin breaks the water right beside us."
"This is strange. I live in Seattle and take the ferry to Bremerton a few times a year and we almost always see an orca on one of those ferry rides. Thought it was a lot more common based on that.

I‚Äôve even seen one on the ferry to Bainbridge Island which is a lot more rare."
I thought the PNW Orcas didn‚Äôt actually migrate. They have their own population....?
"Unfortunately even the regulatory distance is too close, the industry of using boats at all to whale watch is detrimental to their habitat. Watching off the coast or on non motorized boats is the only way to be sure not to bother them"
"This was very interesting and informative.  Thank you very much!!!

What about the kayakers???  I see pictures all the time of kayakers paddling almost right ~~underneath~~ on top of them.  Is this allowed???"
"Just wondering, is it safe to swim in the waters with orca nearby? They kinda scare me ([reminds me of this from my childhood](https://static1.fjcdn.com/comments/Personally+i+dont+think+theyre+spirits+_d00e45b0f9f72a8bd3e67e5cd16c9746.png)), I can‚Äôt imagine how terrified I‚Äôd be if I realized one was quietly staring at me underwater.."
"Huh? Go anywhere Victoria to sooke and down to orcas Island you can see them regularly.

Even tofino is reliable to see them often"
"Lol what? Depends where you are taking about, but there are two regions (Gulf islands off victoria and northern vancouver island) that have almost permant summer populations... and you realllllly have to be unlucky to see them on a whale watching trip. Mind you the ~70 whales off victoria, known as the southern residents that feed primarily on salmon have been a little more unpredictable this year and returned much later in the summer than normal due to low salmon stocks."
"Hey, at least the Sea World detainees get to bathe now and again."
[deleted]
Wow.  I might take the mullet over the *Orcas*.
"Could also be orcas island. That where I thought it looked like immediately. And the place is literally named after killer whales because they mate there every season. If it is, plenty of people live there, my brother got married there two years ago!"
Congrats seems like an interesting place to live
Is it bad that I now have death goals?
This is amazing. Reminds me a bit of Moana. Sorry for your loss.
"wow, thats a pretty epic sendoff for Granny!"
"Great, now they have a taste for humans."
"Nah, they were like, ""Please stop dumping that ash in our blowholes."""

"That‚Äôs incredible, I‚Äôm happy you witnessed that"
...isn‚Äôt that a tactic they use to bump their prey off small islands and glaciers? I think you almost got eaten alive dude..
My family and I were there last week!  It‚Äôs an incredible place and we miss it already.   Have fun!
"That documentary is kind of a load of BS, though. 
https://youtu.be/slnKjx8rDsw"
"I went there just to see orcas and waited for hours but didn't see any. While waiting, this group of friends came by and were talking about how they had also gone to the park that morning and saw a group breaching as well as seals splashing around on the rocks. I almost cried from jealousy."
"3 resident pods* And transients that are there pretty often. This year we've actually been seeing the transients instead of the residents, who went missing for about 2 months. Unfortunately due to low fish stocks (sole food source of the resident pods) the resident pods have been struggling. Luckily the population of pinnipeds (sole food source of the transient pods) has gone up significantly which means the transients are around longer and in greater numbers than before."

did you guys Orcastrate this together?
"That's what I was thinking, too. Ex-Orcas islander here."
I was thinking it was nearby Doe Bay
"I assume the location of any given pod is not readily available information? Kept secret for their safety?

Asking because I kayak around the island regularly but have only seen orca a handful of times."
"It looks like it! Hiked the West Coast Trail there and two nights a bunch of whales (not orcas, I forget what kind) were breaching closer to shore. Was amazing to watch them from our campsite."
I live on Whidbey Island (just south of the San Juan‚Äôs) .. and can confirm. We have been able to see them from the San Juan ferry on occasion. We have been lucky enough to see the spouts of Gray whales from our grocery store parking lot.
Check out Tofino if you‚Äôre in the area. It‚Äôs beautiful

So majestic
All I can hear is the beginning of that Michael Jackson song when watching this.
"Their diet consists nearly entirely of Chinook, which is why many restaurants in the area no longer serve it. 

However, you can still dream of a glorious end. In all seriousness, I‚Äôve never been worried about being eaten by an orca."
Lol
I believe a Land Raider is the only suitable option
You dont know that...
I think you and I need to have a chat about the different states of guacamole.
Have you seen their new gas station? Near the general store on your way to Sooke. Very uptown now lol
There‚Äôs less rural places on the island where people do see this from their backyards
Gibson
Definitely around the San Juan islands. That was my immediate thought.
"Renfrew really is amazing. You get to stop at Shirley Delicious, camp at Pacheedaht Bay and visit the beaches. It sucks here, no one else come please."
"I was on a fishing trawler and the Marine mammal observer was complaining he wasn't seeing any. Skipper told he just uses his radar to find them. 

How's that?

Easy we just look for the cluster of small boats chasing these poor animals around."
Dude if that's true you're insanely lucky. You might wanna try the lotto.
"We were lucky enough to see ~6 orcas crossing our ferry's path on the way to Bainbridge, it was spectacular. Locals at Bainbridge were telling us that they've never seen them before. The captain of the ferry made an announcement that they had to stop the boat to allow all of them to pass."
"Whaaaat. I've been on that ferry a couple dozen times and I always intently stare at the water trying to see a whale, but I've never seen one from that ferry, or any ferry up here. I'd say you're quite lucky."
That's insanely lucky. I commute Bremerton to Seattle daily and have never seen one.
This never ever happens to me
"I would agree, lucky. And based on the original comment we‚Äôre talking about living somewhere where you regularly see them from your house. When you‚Äôre on a boat you cover a lot more distance and your chances of seeing one would probably increase."
"PNWer here, there is a resident pod, yes."
"There's a pod that just chills and eats salmon, but we've been fucking up salmon populations for a long time, so they aren't doing great."
"Some migrate, some don't. We have pods moving through inner Vancouver Island almost every day this time of year. Some are going north towards Alaska but we have a pod that just hangs out here too."
"We have Southern Resident Orcas, of which there are 3 pods/families totaling about 75 whales. They eat salmon and spend the summer/fall months in the Salish Sea in anticipation of the salmon run (primarily Chinook salmon). They travel between California and Alaska the rest of the year. Then, there are transient orcas that eat mammals, like seals, and they have a larger range and don't visit on a set schedule like the Residents do."
"Resident orcas still migrate, the name is deceiving. Primary difference is that they eat salmon."
They definitely come down the Cali coastline in the spring/summer during migration.
"You‚Äôre right- this is a common misconception! There are no migratory orca ecotypes in the PNW. They do follow some patterns, but those patterns are based on salmon runs- they follow the food. Same goes for mammal eating orcas, which are seen much more around here with our healthy pinniped population (which does not need to be controlled by slaughtering seals). 

I work for the center for whale research, out of the San Juan Islands in Washington State. The resident orcas, back before we depleted our salmon populations in the Salish Sea, would stay in the puget sound for most, if not all, of the year. They‚Äôll only go to Alaska if that‚Äôs where they can find salmon. Not because they‚Äôve evolved to travel there during the year."
"Or you could just go see them at Sea World, right?

(Kidding, kidding, I swear!)"
"A kayaker paddling underneath an orca... that sounds like an interesting concept. Kinda like in Free Willy when the Orca jumps the rock jetty I'd imagine, eh?"
I‚Äôm pretty sure there has been no documented cases of orcas killing/harming people in the wild. Stick them in a bathtub and things understandably change
"There's never been a recorded attack on humans outside of [captivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tilikum_(killer_whale). I seem to remember someone that studies orcas telling me they wear specially textured wetsuits that scatter sonar waves - which makes it harder for the orcas to 'sense' them. However, i can't find a reference for that."
"Yes and no?

They're giant wild animals, and an absolute apex predator. Not generally something you want to kick it with.

That said, they're also ocean bros, and there hasn't been a single clearly intentional attack on humans in the wild. There have been some that appeared to be accidental, but Orcas seem to not have any desire to fuck with us (unless we imprison them)."
"I‚Äôve been on a paddle board drifting along with a pod as they moved through a channel off Camano Island. I had thought I heard onshore ‚Äúlook, porpoise!‚Äù and started to paddle out to them. I was SO SURPRISED to see the black and white, the tall dorsal fins...my sister and my kids approached in kayaks (‚Äúno, ORCAS‚Äù) and we stayed near for about a quarter mile drift. Then a little drove of fish surfaced swimming our way (upstream) which popped our little magical rainbow puffy cloud moment and we oh-shitted out of there in case the pod turned around for lunch! You can hear the breath from the blowhole from a decent distance away because they exhale with such force. Every pod I‚Äôve seen had one obvious bull male and a little baby. So amazing. Not an everyday occurrence so each sighting sinks in."
https://images.app.goo.gl/fGWrrrr8kkN3pqJ57
"And here I sit thinking a .44 caliber is the best way to go, landlocked with no orkas within a 2 day drive from where I want to pull the trigger."
Granny lookin like a whole snack üê≥
afaik the 'bumping prey off ice shelves' is a distinct technique that only select pods developed on their own.
Well damn I did not know this
"John Stossel is a total tool. The segment doesn't really address the primary focus of Blackfish which was the breeding program and the OSHA case. Stossel's video was such a textbook case of whataboutism and emotional reactionism that seeks to justify ignoring real criticism. Yes of course there are excesses in Blackfish, but finding some errors doesn't invalidate the main thrust of the work. Who knows if SeaWorld paid money for this, but more likely it was a subtle quid pro quo. SeaWorld only gave Stossel access to their employees and park because they knew he would put them in a good light.

tl;dr Stossel is a trash reactionary"

"Staying stationary and waiting for them to come to you is going to be **very** hit or miss. Spend the money for the whale watching tour, they guarantee sightings."

What about gravy?
Sooke potholes are awesome.
"Sunshine Coaster here, saw the resident pod earlier this week."
"There are, I just remember those houses in the background from when I was there, and saw a pod of orcas jumping."
It‚Äôs probably just the times of year that I go because that‚Äôs the constant.
"There has been some cases of wild orcas accidently hurting people though, A surfer in california got bit by a orca that required 100 stitches, A new zealand free diver got dragged down by a orca that later took his bag of crayfish."
I'd like to see someone fit an orca in a bathtub.
"There has been some cases of wild orcas accidently hurting people though, A surfer in california got bit by a orca that required 100 stitches, A new zealand free diver got dragged down by a orca that later took his bag of crayfish."

"Hey there,

Sometimes things can suck. Sometimes really bad. Sometimes you wake thinking it's all you can take and you've had enough. People have these thoughts and that's okay. It's what you do with those thoughts that matters. It can be difficult pulling yourself out of a slump like that. Trust me, I know. But the most important part in that sentence is that while it's difficult, it IS possible.

Start setting really small goals for yourself. If you're really unhappy at work, try and take 5-10 minutes a day to work on your resume. Fast forward a week and you'll have a rough draft. Then spend 5-10 on researching interview questions and company history. A could months later you could finish your resume and have a list of jobs you're interested in, you've researched, etc. Change doesn't come overnight but it does come if you work for it, and not everyone's able to make sudden dramatic life alerting changes in a day like you often see on TV or in movies. 

I don't know your situation and it's likely completely unrelated to the example but the point stands. Small minutes are a great starting place to allocate towards change, and they add up. 

I hope you day starts looking better and feel free to reach out if you need to chat. You got this though! If things get depressing sometimes, just remember: you're not doing anything necessarily wrong. We're all just trying to do the best we can to live this life and even when it doesn't seem like it, it's a life worth living."
"Heya buddy, you good?"
"I heard that too, but in this case I don't think it's unreasonable to assume he ran into one of those pods. He may have almost gotten eaten that day.."
There's so many [examples](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=orcas+using+waves+). Dude..
"What do you think about the documentary, itself?"
"No, just not a fan of people lying to get support"
"Yeah I really regret listening to everyone who said not to ""waste"" money on a tour because we could see them from the park no problem. I definitely will go on one next time I make a trip up there."
Maybe I would support that industry if they didn't buzz so close to orca pods... those boats can be real jackasses.
It's fucking lit

"Hehe, get out of my post history you tickle-fingered creep!"
"How is it up there? Its on my list of places I'd love to visit and consider moving to... Ive checked out the Olympics and the Cascades before, and Bellingham, but have yet to putz around the islands themselves. Are folks friendly? Do you get island fever? Does it feel somehow cooler than normal life to be on an island? Hows the community?"
What do you do there if I may ask?
My brothers wedding was there two years ago! Beautiful place. His wife‚Äôs grandparents live there. I can‚Äôt wait to make it back sometime.
Honeymooned on Orcas. It was amazing and we want to go back. Mia's Cafe was one of my favorites.
"One of my favorite places to go camp with friends. It‚Äôs got some of everything I love it. An insane skate park, a lake with cliffs, cool little hikes, an amazing little town with the nicest people ever. I tell myself I could live there but the only thing that holds me backs is I obsess mountains and snow in the winter so it would make all of that a journey of its own."
I mean bamboo is already toxic and they eat enough to kill multiple men on the daily
"I had a friend who met one kayaking and said that making eye contact with them is uncanny because it feels like an earnest connection. It probably is, too."

Ehhh I find that it gets way too crowded and way too dirty once the heat waves hit.

J-pod and k-pod over a month late this year. I thought something had happened to them all.
Unless you‚Äôre remembering those exact specific houses it could be any island next to the state of Washington up to Vancouver Island and the Sunshine Coast
"I think the point is that the specially textured wetsuit makes it safer to get up close and personal without it being as dangerous. That would be humans being smart, not dumb. A normal wetsuit would make it more dangerous vs the special wetsuit, if I understand correctly."
"I really like how some people genuinely care, even about random strangers on the internet. If everyone would, I doubt there would be one soul out there wanting to end their lives for any other than maybe physical reasons...

Thanks for caring, [northforthesummer](https://www.reddit.com/user/northforthesummer/)"
Awesome
"scary thought for sure, but there are no recorded incidents when orcas ate/killed a human iirc?"
"Everything about the OSHA case and breeding program is good. The dorsal collapse, while interesting, is overblown as a side effect of captivity. So, anything in Blackfish about the psychology of the whales is a total stretch. My personal take: Keeping predators in zoos is unethical. They always need more space than can be provided and they aren't performing their vital function in the food chain of keeping populations low. My hope is that VR will replace the zoo experience by providing real immersive footage of these animals in their natural environment."
"He wasn‚Äôt asking 

>	Green Tyranny's argument, however, relies heavily on cooperation from SeaWorld, as the company looks to rebuild its image following the documentary's release."
"Yeah unless you're going to spend a week straight hanging around looking, the tours are more than worth your money. I've seen orcas, gray whales, harbor seals, otters, a dead sea lion that a pod of orcas was eating, and more bald eagles than I can count. If you check Groupon ahead of time you can usually grab tickets for about $60 ($50 for the ticket on groupon then $10 in taxes/fees when you book)."
There are very strict rules about how close you're allowed to get to orcas. At this point it's 300 yards which is not close at all. The only ones getting closer are the non commercial vessels that don't know the law.
"Clearly not everyone in this threat knows that, so I think it was good to clarify it for the prior wooooshes."
"It is the bees knees. Grab a kayak friend, the water's nice!"
"Born and raised on the island. Never plan on leaving, the weather is amazingly temperate and it‚Äôs a lot more chill than Vancouver. There‚Äôs a reason it‚Äôs called The Hawaiian Islands of Canada."
"People on my island (San Juan) are super nice, and weird. It‚Äôs a gorgeous place to live. I didn‚Äôt grow up here, so yeah after a few weeks I do start to feel a little bored/trapped and I head off island haha"
"Tis the best place. Mountain views wherever you are on a clear day, mountain on the island, tons of bays, no traffic lights. 

A few summers ago a black bear literally swam from the Bellingham area to Orcas island. Why? Because it‚Äôs that good.

Edit to say my husband just informed me they had another bear there this summer. Probably the same bear, trying to live it‚Äôs best life in the SJ archipelago."
"Well I‚Äôd tell you what I did there, but then you‚Äôd sort out my identity in no time.

For fun: everything. It‚Äôs incredible."
My wedding was there 2 years ago too! No need for a destination wedding for us when you live on the literal destination.
Yeah the skate park is pretty damn insane considering the population is 7-8k in the off season. Not sure how we got so lucky.

I just thought you meant the special wetsuit makes them undetectable to the orcas which makes it likely they could hurt you without them knowing you‚Äôre there
"Even when we all care, mental health can be a struggle, but there's a lot we can do to help."
"I‚Äôve been told any animal will eat you under the right circumstances, even your dog. There have been cases where a human dies or passes out in their home, and their pet was seen to be eating their owner‚Äôs noses, ears, or eyes not soon after. Slightly different context but the orcas could have just been starving"
"Lol that video is basically, ‚ÄúSeaWorld says it‚Äôs not true.‚Äù 

SeaWorld orcas frequently die extremely young (20‚Äôs-30‚Äôs) compared to their wild counterparts who can live to around 100, like Granny. 

49 orcas have died at SeaWorld since the 60‚Äôs. 

Sooooooo wtf SeaWorld? Clearly SOMETHING isn‚Äôt right.

"As a semi-recent graduate from the Atlanta Area Council, I know exactly what campground that is.  As SPL I modeled hydration by filling up 10 nalgenes and carrying them around in a backpack.  1 per hour, at the hottest hours of the day.

I would also propose a toast to random things at random times.  The toasts were very silly, like toasting to a random bush or something.  And everyone was required to drink water until me or one of my staff, whoever was leading the toast, stopped drinking themselves.

No one suffers from dehydration in my troop.  NO ONE I SAY."

Oh hey he‚Äôs got a Camp Rainy Mountain bottle! I remember when I camped there... the septic system had filled up so all the toilets were clogged and there was feces in the showers and then there was a quarantine due to some people get seriously sick with the flu. Good times
"Nalgenus, Thee Unbreakable"

"Since people don‚Äôt seem to understand this here:
The Boy Scouts of America require scouts to complete the following merit badges (as well as a few others) in order for the scouts to acquire their buffs and thereby transform them into ‚ÄúEagle Scouts‚Äù :

Lifesaving: This applies a 15% a second passive heal, which stacks based on how many scouts are within 100 yards. An Eagle Scout within this range raises this heal to a 30% heal due to the Eagle‚Äôs ‚ÄúSPL/ASPL‚Äù buff. 

Citizenship in the Community, Nation, and World: this trains the scout to be the perfect mole for the BSA higher ups. Essentially they become Jason Bourne. 

Communication: This, while innocent sounding, actually applies an active hearing buff that can be controlled by the scout. When activated, the scout can decipher and understand all languages, as well as being able to hear any words said around them (so long as they are repeated twice.) 

Personal Fitness: Standard combat buff. Raises STR, DEX, and CON by a factor of 10. Is usually used with characters that have a lower INT, and WIS. not recommended for low CHA builds as it may cause the scout to take a ‚Äútoo cool for scouting‚Äù debuff, wherein the scout won‚Äôt be allowed to attend the monthly training ses...campouts. Monthly campouts. 

Emergency Preparedness (optional): Should they pick Emergency Prep. they will receive the ability to always know the correct response to any emergency, in any situation. Almost like an omniscient God, except more refined. Although difficult to obtain, it‚Äôs worth it to the exceptional scout. 

Environmental Science OR Sustainability: 
If a scout chooses Environmental Science, they form a covenant with the Earth itself, wherein she will protect and provide for the scout, so long as they practice the ancient rite of ‚ÄúL√¶v√™ N√ò Tr√§√ß√™‚Äù. 
If a scout chooses Sustainability, they gain the ability to manipulate the Earths resources in such a way that they are never depleted. When paired with a ‚ÄúPioneering‚Äù buff, which allows the scout to craft any form of weapon using only rope and sticks, it can be incredibly potent. 

Personal Management:
This where they teach you to handle the throngs of women that will flock to the scout once they become an Eagle Scout.

Swimming: This is where the scouts learn to swim so that they are prepared for when they are drowning in pussy later. 

Camping: Tbh, they just needed a filler here. Logistical issues. The only benefit to picking this one up is that the scout can find suitable shelter in any situation, and is alway able to set up a tent correctly, regardless of weather or light conditions. 

Cooking: This is so the scout can prepare and consume the souls of those whom he has bested in combat. It is the only suitable form of sustenance for such a mighty warrior. 

Family Life: The BSA has realized that almost 50% of marriages end in divorce, so they teach scouts how to have a good marriage. 



TLDR: I‚Äôm high as fuck, and I‚Äôm a proud Eagle Scout so I thought it‚Äôd be fun to go through the list of merit badges and give them game mechanics."

Imagine being one of two people in your jamboree troop whose turn it is to go fill bottles and theres 50 other people in your troop. You need two belts because no one wants to give you their backpack and you make like a bandolier of nalgene bottled

Came here to write this
"Same, some of the most fun I've ever had."
I hated it. Quit after a year. Probs just bc I don't like the outdoors.
2014 Eagle Scout here. Some of the best adventures of my life. Where my Philmont gang at?
"For my Troop, it‚Äôs pretty much the opposite. Every SPL for the past few years (me included) have fainted from dehydration"
And also the guy hitting the fattest whip in the background.
I've been sailing from a young age and the scouts used to do their main summer camp out on our grounds the same week we did our summer camp. Damn theirs was lame. I was between 14 and 17 at the time and the scouts drank water and ate marshmallows whilst in the cam next door we were slamming beers and ordering pizza delivery.
My troop is going to summer camp this week and I have to stay behind for school. It suuuuuucccckkkks
That and peircing damage.

"""Furiously pressing X to skip the intro cutscene"""
I‚Äôm from this troop. We went to Philmont earlier this summer and did this.

My friend dropped his down a mountain at Philmont. We found it later that week scratched to hell but it could still hold water
"If you break one, and mail it them, they will mall you a new one back , and a sticker that says ‚ÄúI broke a nalgene‚Äù"
Gold? I have not heard of that one.
"One of the boys in my troop got really mad at me at FSB this year, so he started beating me with his nalgene. It broke on me, and he was screaming ‚ÄúIm TiREd Of ThIS!!!!‚Äù The entire time!"
"Only Nalgene I've ever broken was one that fell in the way mid-swing when breaking up clay soil with a pickaxe during an archaeology dig. Even bearing the brunt of the pickaxe, it was only cracked and not fully broken. Wrapped that fucker in duct tape and used it for three more years."
I had to scroll way too far to find this comment.
The council strip also says Atlanta
The water bottle says crm so I think this is at camp Rainey mountain in NEGA council
Camp rainy mountain
well i‚Äôve met three other 444 troops but from different councils than me so i think there can be same numbers just not in the same council
That's gotta be at Woodruff Scout camp. Spent a lot of fun years there.
That belt loop is the true boss
I lived on peace tea at CRM. It was cheap at the trading Post so I just kind of bought a bunch of it every day.

Oh my God I went there in like 2006 and recognized that hill up to the bunk. Great camp!
"I went a few years ago, it was so fuckin good. Choose Camp Rainey Mountain, I recognized the background and then one of the bottles had the CRM logo, brought me back"
It's amazing how I missed every trip up there but still somehow know exactly which camp you're talking about.
"I knew I recognized that hill! Haven't been there in years, but it just has that Look‚Ñ¢ to it"
"This is surreal, there's a picture on the front of Reddit and I know exactly where it was taken."
Was that the swine flu year? I swear half our troop got knocked out with it

You ascend into an Eagle Scout where you duel wield bottles and knives.
I must be the only person who was in scouts who wasn‚Äôt obsessed with knives. I was more into having 20 different flashlights.
"*Creates a leatherwork cozy that can fit the bottle and a knife*

Then you weren't in on the secret Boy Scout Knife black market bud.
"Your troop didn‚Äôt study the blade.

You're supposed to sharpen them.
It's not about age. My troop did our totin chips and fireman chits about two weeks after crossing over.

"My first troop was boy (scouts planned and executed events) led and was the absolute shit. Second troop had a lot more parent involvement, wasnt nearly as fun."
I didn‚Äôt know my dad ran a boy scouts troop
The older scouts used to wrestle me and make me blow hard.
"I was in a troop like that, so I just transferred to a better one. I'm happy I didn't ditch the whole thing, scouts was so great."
"Mine was too, so I made a fuckin presentation to call them out on it.  Then I changed troops"
"Mine was too! And to top it off they were Mormon. Still, floating the middle fork of the salmon and backpacking was the best!"

"If you can‚Äôt handle me at my worst, obey your thirst."
It's more than a feeling
I did the same but it was pretty much tradition in my troop
Yeah. Though my troop still asks me to do badge designs every now and then.
"Most of us in my troop didn't hit eagle until very close to 18. Many of us went on to college or military service, so it was a sort of tradition to go to your court of honor, then bounce.

A lot of us would stay registered to instruct badges and come back during holiday breaks and help with fundraising, but I think I was the only one who stayed around as an adult leader."
Same here. I had a best friend I made via the scouts who moved up north but I haven't been able to find him on Facebook. Maybe Dylan will see this lol. Troop 182. Never made it to Eagle rank though. Oh well.
"I had a Mormon troop so I was always messing with them. Still, the activities and camp outs made my soul sing."
*music stops*
Haha that might do it. I quit because we stopped doing things outdoors as much.
I quit because the leadership was shit and all the people there were rednecks and I was the only guy who wasn't white.
Boy Scouts are good at traditions like that
"In our Troop, it was kids fainting from ""locking their knees."" 

I'd literally never heard of such a thing till watching these 12-15 year old kids eat dirt at volunteer events. I'm still not totally convinced they weren't just dehydrated, but the older guys insisted it was because they were locking their knees for too long. 

Who doesn't shift their weight when they're standing for long stretches of time?"
"I've only every been to a BSA-run camp once, but it did involve someone passing out on me, while waiting in line to eat, due to heat exhaustion or dehydration."
"Our SPL tradition for the past few years has been roasting marshmallows without hands, only the SPL's can do it, and it's only during our weeklong trip to MaKaJaWan, that avoids *most* injuries lmao."
"I like the story of the kid in my troop who had to go to the hospital after drinking a 12 pack of mountain dew.

Or a kid from another troop who shot gunned two espresso energy drinks and then swam the mile swim after the wilderness survival outing. 

Or the kid who burnt his head after walking around all day wearing a pot for a hat. 

Or the 17 year old who looked like a 11 year old.

Or the kid that tried to make a robot that could slap people in the robotics class.

Or the kid who was still sleeping when we had our campsite flag ceremony in the morning and two of the older scouts picked up his cot and put him outside at the flagpole.

Or the kids who put meatballs in the hot chocolate at NYLT without telling us first.

Or the kid who chucked half a stick of summer sausage, that we forgot to put in a tree, into the woods so we wouldn't get eaten by raccoons.

This is why I'm so torn about girls joining boy scouts. On one hand, I really like just hanging out with a bunch of guys, not having to worry about what girls think. On the other hand, it's such an amazing experience that I don't want to deny from anybody."
It‚Äôs all about survival type stuff in scouts so ordering pizzas and such is a no go (except for the time one of the dads in our troop got everyone steaks because he owns an outback. He caters a lot but never just getting people their own steaks so it was pretty funny)

"BSA scout shorts/pants are the best things known to man, I have hanged two, one-liter water bottles from my shorts and the belt loops never broke. Plus the number of pockets is amazing."
Yeet. I thought so. I worked there as a staffer this year
I would‚Äôve enjoyed that camp more if my troop wasn‚Äôt shitty
"Camp Rainy Mountain? Not gonna lie that was the worst summer camp lol. They didn't have a pool, they had really stupid curfew hours. There wasn't a whole lot to do in our free time, and I could tell the other Troops felt the same. we don't line up in the morning for breakfast and they'd make an announcement that some kids had filled the washer and dryers up with ketchup. And then the next day someone loosened the ropes on the log tower or whatever they built in front of the mess hall and it fell down."
Might‚Äôve been. What year was that?

"Mine does, but he‚Äôs a good man and everyone loves him. He‚Äôs going to have to step down soon though because he‚Äôs sick and not getting better. I know they/me will miss him when he‚Äôs gone, he‚Äôs a good person."

Also half of the kids were jerks so 12-13 y/o me couldn't take it.
Guess I got lucky-ish. Most of the guys in my group were cool. Met my best friend but he moved up North (still looking for him but haven't been able to find him lol) and the others left too. Never made it to Eagle rank but I enjoyed my time there. Kinda wish there was like Man Scouts or some shit. I enjoyed it but I gotta work and be an adult :(.
It‚Äôs not a real jamboree if you don‚Äôt have people passed out from the heat
"It happens a lot during ceremonies, and even weddings. When my parents got married, they had to explicitly tell my dad to stop locking his knees, so it‚Äôs apparently semi common"
"I saw dozens of adults faint from locking their knees while in the military. They try to drill it into your head to not lock your knees, especially when standing in formation, but people still do it anyway"
"I'm 24 and the first time I've heard about ""locking your knees"" was on Reddit a few months ago. Nobody ever told me that. I've never heard anyone talk about it."
Kid in my elementary ‚Äúlocked his knees‚Äù and fainted during a chorus concert. We were inside. He wasn‚Äôt dehydrated.

You guys are forgetting that if he also acheved his Firemans Chit he also wields the ability to set knives and water bottles on fire to cause extra burn damage.

Am Eagle too. I put knives IN the water bottles. They are my deadly maracas.
Nothing like ranking up two weeks before your friends and then acting like you're the greatest human alive.
"Fellow Eagle here, also subbed to both. You just develop an appreciation for water and pokie things."
I remember this one guy in our council who carried around one of those folding knives that was like a foot long. Thing was bordering on being a machete.
You're right! You try harder to cut things with a dull blade so once you do cut what you wana cut your hand will most likely go flying and you could stab yourself or someone else if they're within arms length.
The key word is Boy Scouts of **America**
"For explanation: Boy Scouts of America use a sort of lisemce system when allowing the kids to use knives or start fire. First you get trained and take a test to get a lisence ( totenchit for knives, firemenchit for fires) then you are allowed to carry a knife or start fires unsupervised, and you get liscence cards and all. But if you get caught breaking rules or being reckless, or otherwise fucking around with knives/fire, you can get a strike against you ( corner cut off your liscence). Lose 4 corners and you loose your permission to carry a knife/lighter. It is a good system."

Then 2 backpacking trips a year & the international brotherhood vampires with Canada is always fun in the fall too. 

Shits fucking awesome, some of the best kids too, great friends.

"Go join a local troop as a leader! That's what I did, it's a blast. 

I get to say ""ask your SPL whenever some random kid interrupts my monthly campout."
Sorry to hear about your dad. Hope the Troop he built keeps going. My dad built a Cub Pack basically from scratch for 8 years and it dissolved 6 months after he stepped down. Hopefully the legacy your dad built lasts and it passes on to more Scouts!
"My mom is the same I am not sure how much time she's got. Maybe a year or two.

We put about 30 packets of Gatorade mix into a single nalgene and it turned into a honey-like substance after a while.

Also it creates a more jagged cut if you do cut yourself and that makes healing more difficult. A sharp blade is a safer blade if you‚Äôre not a complete moron.

Is that new? I don't remember anything like that. I guess it was a long time ago for me though.
"That's always the best. The scouts want to do things, so having them run the troop makes perfect sense. In my experience the adult-led troops don't do as many trips."
"It‚Äôs ok, it‚Äôs been a bit coming. After I lost my mom I didn‚Äôt figure he‚Äôd be around much longer without her, but he‚Äôs still here, and for that I‚Äôm grateful. I would love for the troop to keep going, but unfortunately we don‚Äôt even really have enough kids. He actually took it over from another scout master, and he was originally my cub master. It all started with me being a kid and asking him to be around more and he took it as ‚Äútake over the cub pack‚Äù. I‚Äôm hoping we‚Äôll pick up more kids, but with the rule changes plus us living in the rural south, this may be the end of the little troop, but during his time we pushed through 4 eagles including myself and we may have one or two more before we run out of kids"
"I wouldn‚Äôt say start up a trans only troop just because that will take away from people that aren‚Äôt trans and want to get the experience. But here they don‚Äôt even like the fact girls are able to get into scouts. I mean hell when I was still under 18 I had a fling with another male and one of the leaders found out and he was trying very very hard to make sure I was pushed out((no one listened to him so it‚Äôs all good)). Honestly though, go for it. No matter what anyone says, it‚Äôs so lovely being able to help the kids and learn some things yourself. Stay true to the scout law and you‚Äôll never go wrong"
"Basically, kind of a big deal."
Some people faint due to locking their knees as they end up hyper-extended and can cut off blood return flow. Doesn't happen to everyone depending on your structure. I can stand for about 30 minutes before having to shift my weight around a bit or else my legs fall asleep. More than an hour or 2 and I just begin to hate life but as long as I keep shifting the weight from one leg to the other every 10-15 minutes I can stand for hours.

you can also do sneak in the 3 phase version. you bum rush her at the start and you can cheese an assassination. second phase you can do a dive on her and assasination during the fog. the only phase you really have to fight is the last one.
Fuckin truth. All these non-adjustable ass knots
"I actually didn't know about bum rushing for a backstab. I always assumed that the moment an enemy aggro'd, they wouldn't let you get the backstab because they'd just turn to face you each time. Diving and catching bosses in midair are two really easy ways to cheese out a deathblow though.

Also, any enemies that require the Mortal Blade to finish them also get interrupted by Mortal Draw, which is incredibly useful for both of the ape fights (Mortal Draw interrupts the terror scream)."

">One boy had a cut almost 5cm deep. St John Ambulance staff noted that ""trachea and some cartilage"" were visible.

1.  Fucking hell

2.  Do they actually mean ""5cm deep"" *into* the throat or 5cm across the surface of the throat?  Asking for a friend."
My wife put the show on at her high school. The shop teacher/set guy ground the razors down so dull they wouldn't cut butter. They were then kept in a locked location and under complete control at all times not on stage...
"How the hell does that happen?

Surely after the 1st injury someone should have realised that something was wrong - how do you slash two people‚Äôs throats accidentally??

I also am very surprised the school essentially got away with that, whoever was responsible for that production, or whoever was responsible for the props should have faced formal disciplinary action, or even been investigated for negligence."
"Jesus, 5 seconds on the grinder in shop class and these would have been flat. Use your brains people."
Method acting.
"Why is everyone suggesting methods to dull an actual razor to use as a prop in a school play?  A better question is why a school play would need to use a real razor at all?

This is precisely why foam props exist."
"I can't believe nobody is going face any real consequences for this. Two students nearly died because of a razor that had already caused injuries in rehearsals, and all they're doing is ""a restorative justice process with the families concerned""? Giving student actors a supposedly ""safe"" real razor as a prop is criminal negligence."
"I heard next year they're doing ""Rambo""!

With real, loaded guns, but it's ok because they'll put some tape over the muzzle."
"God damnit, props crew... that‚Äôs just one of the things you just are not negligent about. It‚Äôs one thing if you think it‚Äôs just a prop they never gets picked up, but when you KNOW there is a scene specifically where it‚Äôs used in a would-be dangerous fashion, you make SURE it‚Äôs safe! That‚Äôs just basic safety! Blatant negligence, that was.

I worked at a local theatre once, great fun, but safety is no joke on set. You build a set wrong or wiff a prop, things can collapse and people can get seriously hurt. There is a lot to consider in theatre, more than I think people give it credit for."
"""One boy had a cut almost 5cm deep"" Jesus"
Fucks sake they literally sell straight razors that take disposable safety razor blades. looks identical to the audience but is totally harmless with the blade removed from the holder.
"Four popsicle sticks, one round toothpick and some paint and all of this could have been avoided... especially with an actual straight-razor to model!"

"What the hell is a ""a restorative justice process""?  
I had to google it..  
  
Why the hell would this prevent prosecution for criminal negligence?  
Especially after people already got cut...  
  

  
Note: besides arteries, which are pretty important, cutting the trachea like that can well damage vocal cords..  
there may a scar there for life..  
and another point: plenty of nerves running through the neck, depending how wide the cut was made.  
  
It doesn't take long to test whether a blade is blunt..  
and honestly, this blade shouldn't have been a sharp one to begin with (imo).  
Tinkering project: remove the metal blade, replace with a plastic toy knife blade, grinded to size, blunted-rounded 'edge'.  
add metallic paint if needed.  
  
And just think: these are students.  
How many parents were watching the *opening night* of the show, to see not one, but TWO students have their throats slit?  
  
And the parents signed the report recommending criminal charges..  
  
fuuuuuuuuuck.  
  
traumatized for life, can see it now, you get a leading role in the chair, after repeated assurances that they've made sure *this time* that everything is safe and dandy.. aaaaand you get your throat slit.  
Or being a parent of one of those boys, or a sibling, and watching that, then rush to hospital, surgery...  
  
I hope some of the families can sue 'WorkSafe' for not giving them a chance at justice."
Just one question. Who in their right mind uses a Razor on a second person if you already injured someone else with the same one?
"5 cm deep doesn't sound right. That would go through the artery and the bleeding would be ""fountainous""."

"1st kid gets throat cut. Starts screaming and runs off stage.
-
Teacher: ""fucking Billy always improvising! Stay on script you little shit! Ok lets hope Tim does what he's suppose to-""
-
Tim gets throat cut, squirts blood everywhere and flops to the floor. 
-
Teacher: ""Now thats acting.
-
Lights dim, actors run off stage, tim is just laying there In a pool of his blood. 
-
Teach: ""what the fuck is Tim doing? Get up!! Tim! Jesus.""
-
Walks on stage and flips him over, but its too dark to see his grey skin and faded eyes.
-
Teacher: ""TIM. GET THE FUCK UP""
-
No response or movement
-
Teacher calls for extras to drag him off stage.
-
Teach: ""Fucking actors."""
"Why the fuck would you use a real razor?

An aluminum foil and wood would suffice."
"Kiwis, always: ""Lil' duct tape and she'll be right"""
So they had a SCENE where someone got their THROAT SLIT with a RAZOR and to ACT out SLITTING a THROAT they gave them a RAZOR and then someones throat got actually SLIT and they gave the razor BACK???? IS THAT WHAT IM GETTING
Did anyone ever consider that this wasn‚Äôt an actor and was in fact the Demon Barber of Fleet Street?
"No offense, if I was given a razor, told it was real or fake, if 100% observe it to see what it really is"
My school preformed that show we used a wood cut out painted silver.
Heads are gonna roll over this.
"I'm no expert on school performances, nor an expert in physiology or medicine......but from regular day everybody guy life experience, it seems like a bad idea to use actual fucking razor blades in a play instead of fake ones.

A bit of child/parent contact wouldn't go astray either. ""What part of the play are you practicing today?  Oh I cut a guys throat/get my throat cut.  Wow, that's pretty intense, do you use fake blood or how does it work?  I dunno, see you later, love ya mom x"""
"You know what I think is hilarious? It was two students, like the first one wasn‚Äôt enough to learn that it was a real blade. Hahaha"
They...didn't study the blade
"Plot twist: They were placed there by a student that was sick of singing the songs,"
"So no problems during any of the rehearsals, and then during the opening night performace someone gets an 8cm long slice that's 5cm deep!? Sounds like that student wanted to kill someone on stage."
"If you're going to be a negligent dumbass and use a real not dulled razor, WHY would you actually draw it over the person's skin??? Just pretend you're doing it and cut the air in front of the neck, you know, ACT like you're cutting it... Especially if people had been injured before! So many decisions were made here and not a single one was intelligent"
"Let‚Äôs see, I need to put something in this bottle that can represent poison. How about ... drain cleaner?"

"I mean it said that there were numerous injuries before due to them being real razors 

""On the show's opening night in April 2016, two students were rushed to hospital after their necks were slit with a sharp shaving razor.
One boy had a cut almost 5cm deep. St John Ambulance staff noted that ""trachea and some cartilage"" were visible.
""Major veins and arteries are located in the region where contact with the straight razor is made. Damage to these veins, and especially the arteries, was life threatening,"" the WorkSafe report states.
""There was a potential for death.""
It wasn't the first time students were injured by the razors, but despite numerous incidents there was no investigation into the razors' safety."""
Oh naw
"I was in my high school‚Äôs production of 12 Angry Men and we did the same thing. It‚Äôs high school theatre, who would use *real* razors."
My high school did a play based on the death of Jessie James. The actors had to make finger guns and couldn't point them at each other.
My brothers' high school production of *West Side Story* used real switchblades (the director never admitted where the got them all). My brothers somehow got the job of bringing them all to our home and grinding the edges into harmlessness. My parents were thrilled.
"my school used a plastic switch blade that was so pathetic, in one performance the blade completely shot out of the handle and they improvised grabbing the blade during their fight . ones on off-broadway now haha."
"I was Tony Montana in my elementary school's production of Scarface: The Musical. You know what we used for cocaine? You guessed it, real cocaine."
"When we did Sound of Music, we used broomsticks as rifles for the nazis. Because, it was a musical! Jeez, people!"
"I get what you're saying, but many professional productions will use specially made prop blades that look terrifyingly real, but are usually harmless. Sword fights tend to get a little different though"
I was in my kindergarten playground's production of Cowboys and Indians and we used imaginary tomahawks to scalp the Cowboys. Same as every kindergarten playground fight. Because *holy shit*
"I was in a high school rendition of Bugsy Malone several months after the Columbine shootings.  In the play there is quite a bit of gratuitous gun violence.   Did we use real guns?  Hell no.  All our gun battles were fought with silly string, and the most grievous injury suffered was from a kid falling off the stage opening night.  No one went home riddled with bullets that weekend."
Literally spray painted cardboard would even look fine for an antique straight razor at stage distances
They must have meant 5mm
"That's what I don't get. 5cm is almost 2inches, which would be really deep."
Deep = into the throat.   Wide = across the throat.
"Yup, St John reported the cut was nearly 5cm deep! The relevant part of the WorkSafe report showing the cut depth is here: [https://imgur.com/a/80H85ol](https://imgur.com/a/80H85ol)"
"I might be wrong but I think in the video they said 8cm across and 5cm deep.

But it does sound pretty ludicrous that someone even survived that, must have been a lucky angle or area on the neck that hasn't got anything too vital that he'd drop dead there and then.

Edit: someone else said they might have meant 5mm which sounds way more realistic."
"Exactly how prop weapons should be treated!

Whoever was responsible for the props here was shockingly negligent."
"They could also just use cardboard, its not like you can tell from the stage.

Or glue tinfoil to cardboard to make it shiny in the stage lights."
This story and the posted one make me think of Brandon Lee.
Why do you even need that? Just buy one where you can replace the razor and then take the razor out.
Why do you even need an actual razor?
"I mean, you're on fucking stage. With someone as small as a razor, cant you just use something that looks like a razor? No ones gonna notice. The closest Seats are like 20 feet away at least."
"Worst thing is that they had several chances to stop before it was too late

  


>The razors had been wrapped in tape by a teacher, but this wasn't sufficient.

>During one rehearsal, a student received a small cut. Another pupil suffered a friction burn a few days before the show.

>The WorkSafe report states Saint Kentigern's Board of Trustees wasn't informed real razors were being used, and ""missed the opportunity"" to investigate the injuries."
"""The razors had been wrapped in tape by a teacher, but this wasn't sufficient.""
Yikes."
">""It wasn't the first time students were injured by the razors, but despite numerous incidents there was no investigation into the razors' safety""

Their teachers are fucking morons."
How does that happen twice!!!
"Obviously, the second one happened when they were showing to the police how the first one happened."
"If they're doing it properly, during ""Joanna"" they slit a throat and tip them to the basement, and the somebody else comes in and they do the same thing in quick succession. They may not have been able to see the first guy and just thought they were acting really well, especially if they were using fake blood."
"""Okay, okay, let's settle down people. We all know the bad news, and we're all mourning the tragic losses in our own way. Now let's talk about the good news. Tommy? Stand up... Congratulations, you are no longer a second understudy... Ladies and gentlemen, let's congratulate our new Judge Turpin, Tommy Jones! I know you'll do a wonderful job. Before we go back to rehearsals, I would like to say, let's be safe out there. And Jason? No one thinks any of our recent troubles are your fault, and you are an amazing Sweeney, but let's be extra sure to double check the props this time. Come on, safety first people. Now break a leg!"""
IDK when we saw it there was fake blood everywhere. Maybe people thought they were just good actors
THE SHOW MUST GO ON
"The students got cut because they had fake prop neck in front of their real ones, the razor was supposed to cut the blood bag to make it seem as though their throats were being cut, however the razor was still sharp enough to go all the way to the actual neck and cut the students.
The teacher responsible for the razor was ‚Äúasked to leave‚Äù and the school was given a fine, as well as having to pay compensation for the students."
"Not to mention that one student's throat was cut 5 fucking cm deep.  Like, were you actually trying to kill your fellow actor?!

Thats seriously fucked up."
"Yeah, it's pretty disappointing. I'm a metal worker and I think my safety officer would really just knock someone out for being that reckless."
"You can barely see what they're using, just grab anything small and blunt. Get a flick comb and use the back or some shit."
"Or use the 3D printer a lot of schools have access to these days. A bit of filling, sanding, and paint and you have a decent replica."
"Not even 5 seconds on a grinder, could have just run the blade Across some concrete once or twice"
Rub it on a fucking rock a few times would of been enough. Those things are designed to have a very sharp but brittle edge.
A lot of schools don't have shop classes anymore :(
"Shop class? What shop class? 

/s

These programs are getting cut as we speak, unfortunately (at least in my area)."
"*Actually dies on stage.* Ah, the old Calculon method."
The ultimate thespian commitment to the craft. Konstantin Stanislavski would be proud to see the ‚Äúsystem‚Äù at work.
Daniel Day Lewis just nutted
"Foam, wood, plastic, chocolate... there's no reason to have a real razor anywhere near the set."
"I'm so confused by all the people talking about their methods to dull razors. If it was a knife, you wouldn't talk about the kids dulling the blades, you'd be like why the fuck are you using an actual knife. 

I remember the episode of the Office with Sweeney Todd and when they're all holding razors in the beginning while singing, and the razors they used look like toys, but do you think anyone actually cares? Meanwhile these kids are using actual razors, like why?"
"My school also used real razors, they got some old already dull ones but were going to get the blades coated in something as well. Before the coating was put on an understudy was waving it around backstage during rehearsals and managed to slice my hand with it. The teachers just rolled there eyes and were like ‚Äúeurgh, of course it was Jack waving it about‚Äù."
"Looks like they were college students, so perhaps old enough to know better.

Edit:  ‚Äúcollege‚Äù = high school in this context"
"I'm all for restorative justice, but restorative justice in this case would be making sure that shit never happens again after the *first* incident. 

i.e. teach incompetent people to be competent or get less incompetent people involved"
"Are you kidding me? That‚Äôll never work!

They obviously need to put tape on the tip of each bullet."
That's a good idea if you're worried about debris fouling the barrel.
"They wanted to do ""Alien"" before that school in NJ did it, but the Xenomorph had a conflict and wouldn't have been able to make rehearsals, so they went with ""Sweeney Todd"" instead."
"This makes me think of what happened to Brandon Lee : (  


The more stories like this I hear of the more disgust I have for those who are flippant about safety."
I loved my time doing props and this is my worst nightmare. We had swords and shit but they‚Äôre extremely dull and I‚Äôd watch like a hawk.
"That's got to be a mistake, unless he got stabbed very hard, I'd say it's 5mm deep or 5cm long. I really hope I'm right..."
Head and neck surgeon here. There's no way that's correct.
"Agree, and they're inexpensive"
The lives of the student actors should be made brief
" LOL This comment made me chuckle out loud, but seriously nobody is getting fired for this?"
That or the person doing the slicing had a vendetta because that fucker Aiden stole his role!
"I remember this happening and had forgotten about it completely, now that you mention it I do remember reading an article in the herald that said exactly that. Fake razor, minimal injury and unsure how it could have happened."
"oh damn, so this article is literally fake news? i mean the site itself doesn't look that reputable, but barely bleeding to life-threatening is a huge stretch. but honestly this makes a lot more sense, high school chemistry doesn't even let us handle baking soda and vinegar without full goggles and gloves. it was still negligent that an injury occured regardless though, but I'm glad to hear there were no serious injuries."
"What about the WorkSafe report? 

https://worksafe.govt.nz/laws-and-regulations/enforceable-undertakings/accepted-enforceable-undertakings/st-kentigern-trust-board/

Edit: fixed link"
Here's an article that does say they were prop razors. https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=11832578
"Restorative justice is simply when victims meet with offenders and all parties, not just lawyers, decide on the sentence. It doesn't prevent criminal prosecution. There is a floor, a minimal sentence, but apparently for this case the family chose not to go hard on the school or teacher."
Also consider the trauma of slitting your friends throat because you've been assured that the blade was safe.
"And a kid had gotten a small cut in a rehearsal.

Just paint a fucking popsicle stick"
"This is the most insane to me. Theres no way he didnt notice his blade cutting the first kids neck, right?"
"I was thinking the same. Like, they couldn‚Äôt even pretend to cut themselves? Did they really have to make contact with the skin?"
"It was over 2 years ago, whatever repercussions were going to happen have already happened. Heads did not roll."
"I don‚Äôt know, that might make Juliet spew red, white, and blue."
"Jesus Heather, what's your damage?"
"No no, that's for Heathers."
Woah there JD
I'm a No-Rust-Build-Up man myself.
Just make sure to tape the top shut.
"Hmmmm...I need it to look like real liquid is in this tiny, brown glass bottle no one can even see from beyond the fourth row.... It's got to be *realistic* it's Shakespeare! (Funny, I'm actually doing Rom and Jul next year.)"

"We sat through three hours of so-called acting last night, and the kiss was the only convincing moment in it!"
Just watched Hot Fuzz last night. Top 5 most entertaining movies.
it's even better when you learn that they're doing a play of the movie Romeo + Juliet with leo dicaprio. that's the whole reason they end it with Lovefool
Absolute tosh wasn‚Äôt it?
Kids got hurt during the fucking rehearsal and they still did it
"You could use a real razor as long as you blunt the edge. Get a rough rock. Attempt to cut the rock with the razor. Keep trying to cut that rock until the razor is well and truly rounded off. Or you know, *buy a prop.*"
You don't use real razors in *any* theatre...
12 Angry Men is such a good movie
"""Always treat your gun like it's loaded, and don't point it anything you don't want to kill.""

""But sir, my gun is just my fingers!""

""ALWAYS TREAT YOUR GUN LIKE IT'S LOADED, AND..."""
"Now that's just sad. I'm not even a gun lover, but damn... When I was in high school we had a Color Guard that carried replica rifles and spun them around in marching formations, and we very definitely used cap guns in drama club. 

Now... Finger guns, and you can't point them at anyone because, what? *They might be loaded?*"
This is the funniest comment so far. ü§£
"My highschool did a play that was a parody of your classic ''Everybody Locked In A House During A Dark And Stormy Night"" murder mysteries, and at the end the Bad Guy holds everybody at gun point. But they wouldn't let us use a prop gun, so we asked to use a prop knife. School said No. So then our director went home and built a prop dynamite vest that looked pretty darn good, and the school gave us an even harder No. So, with two days til the show, we had to improvise. We got this giant plastic Crayola piggy bank that was shaped like a crayon, and had the actress playing the villain say that it was filled with poison. We even added a line about the crayon not being non-toxic. The audience actually loved it because it fit how dumb the play was.

God I miss those days."
"https://insider.foxnews.com/2015/03/07/colorado-first-grader-suspended-pointing-finger-gun-classmate

Kid suspended for pointing finger gun."
"Rule one of gun ownership: Every gun is loaded. That's every gun, and all of the time. 

""But I'm just pointing my fing-""

DID I FUCKING STUTTER"
The school's been confiscating switchblades since the 50s.
The director is lucky to still be employed
"As for where he got them, probably a store. They're not illegal to own in most states, just carry around."
"We used toy pistols for the play Strange Boarders; one broke midway through. The character that was supposed to be using one just went ""nah, I got muscles"" and flexed in the middle of the play since he was being handed a non existent gun."
Yeah 5 cm deep is dead
True performance
"If the article explicitly stated that the boys head was cut clean off and the paramedics managed to sew it back on you would all believe it. Maybe 5cm was a typo, maybe they meant 5mm, or maybe they have to write these articles so quiclly in order to churn them out and they just wrote any old rubbish."
Yeah unless they had hella chins they'd be dead with a 5cm deep cut.
"This is NZ journalism, we're lucky it's spellchecked."
">2inches, which would be really deep.

Girls don't agree"
How is this guy still alive :o
"Well, yeah.  That's what the words mean but it doesn't make sense how they're using them.  Unless the dude was blessed with an abundance of frontal neck fat to cut through, 5cm deep would be already inside the trachea, way more serious than ""trachea and some cartilage were visible""."
"Seems like perhaps they are mistaken here, because that's nuts."
"Yeah, but there‚Äôs no way the cuts were 5cm into the throat and the trachea was just visible. 5cm into it the trachea should be cut through"
He's asking cuz 5 cm into the throat feels like it would definitely ki you.
"Ok, this clears it up. The quote is, 

>According to his medical records (B18) there was an 8cm horizontal laceration to s9(2)(h) neck. The medial 4.5 cm of the wound was deep involving platysma muscles. The lateral 3.5cm was superficial and did not reach the subdermal layer.

This means that 4.5cm of the 8cm cut was deep enough to cause real damage, meaning that the serious portion of the cut wasn't 4.5cm deep, but 4.5cm wide."
Yeah! Imagine if it was a sword or a gun props. This is criminal negligence.
"High school theatre is often a very... lax environment where rules are concerned.

We used to write ""break a leg"" in hair spray on the huge vanity dressing room mirror on opening night and light it on fire."
Props crew here was probably 2 teenagers who just really didnt care. Speaking from experience - thankfully in the plays i did the worse thing people had to hold was a fake cigar.
"Yeah, props to this guy!"
Absolutely. Even fake guns are treated as live weapons on set. Every time. This is negligence of the highest degree.
"Fact: In 100% of prop gun related deaths, the victim is always the one with the fake gun."
"Cardboard cut to the jugular, yay!"
"Fuck that bullshit cardboard cuts ducking hurt, at least with a knife it‚Äôs probably less painful"
If you removed the blade from a [straight razor](https://cremocompany.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/straightshave1890-1.jpg) then you wouldn't really have much left.
"Let me guess, they cut through the tape?"
"You know what looks like a straight razor at a distance? A ruler taped to an eraser, spray painted silver. It's almost like safety was not an issue here."
OMG they could've just blunted them in the parking lot too wtf?!
I‚Äôm almost sure I saw this on Law and Order SVU.
Fresh or anything close to fresh razors are insanely sharp...
Whoever wrapped them should have tested them on themselves
"Not just the teachers but everyone fucking involved. Even as a teenager you need to go ""maybe these need to be fake razors""."
"As are the students!! ""Three other kids got hurt with this, but I'm sure it's fine now, slice be up Dave!"""

My old welding / grinding teacher would hold you down himself and call the cops if someone was that stupid.
"You *clearly* aren't part of the Film Actors Guild union, are you?"
"School theaters are smaller than you think, and you could definitely distinguish a flick comb from a straight razor. That doesn't give them the excuse to use a real straight razor though."
"Exactly this - it‚Äôs a stage play/musical not TV/film the prop doesn‚Äôt have to be that detailed to look ok to an audience. And it‚Äôs a school production - I don‚Äôt think anyone would have minded if their prop razor looked a bit basic!

They could have even got a piece of wood, cut it down a bit and painted it and it would have passed for a razor to an audience."
Wouldn't be enough.  It would still cause some damage.  Full grind down is the only practical solution.

"Literally *anything* but an actual razor! 

Shit, man. If you have to, just use nothing at all! Mime it! The audience can barely see what you're holding anyway."
Chocolate props don't work. They tend to get eaten. I may or may not have been to blame.
I'll keep my fake gun next to my real gun to avoid any confusion
"Also what's with everyone saying to drag it on concrete ""for like five seconds""? That doesn't give you a nice slick smooth non-cutting surface, it fucks up the blade and makes it jagged, now you're sawing at their throat and giving them tetanus."
"In other countries, ‚Äúcollege‚Äù is high school, and ‚Äúuniversity‚Äù is college. This was in New Zealand, where ‚Äúcollege‚Äù means high school."
"While it's called a ""college"", it seems about equivalent to a high school, or at least the students in the play were. Some articles mention 16 year olds. 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Kentigern_College

>Established in 1953, the college is semi-coeducational with a single-gender Middle College for years 7 and 8, with years 9 and 10 single-gender in core subjects and a co-educational Senior College for years 11‚Äì13.

Year 13 = around 17 years old."
College here in NZ =  High School in US so not necessarily that old
"It's possible but as an actor, you don't really pay attention to the props you're given. That's 100% taken care of by someone else. If you're an actor and you're told ""Hey, in this scene you need to pour out 4 cups of 'whiskey' from this bottle"" you're not going to check everyday that the bottle has been cleaned/refilled. You check to make sure the props are there but you don't do anything but use them.

If the whiskey you're supposed to pour has gone bad, you're not gonna take a sip beforehand to be sure. That still falls on the people preparing the props. A blade is definitely a little different but the point still stands."
Hell just a couple months ago there was a country singer in Texas who died while filming his music video. His 'prop' gun accidentally fired...
"> Brandon Lee

Wait, correct me if I'm wrong but wasn't what happened to Brandon Lee just a really unfortunate accident? Something about two different types of blanks and something got stuck. I'd have to google the details but I didn't think anyone thought it was negligence.

I could be wrong."
It must be. A 5cm cut to the throat and you‚Äôre dead before someone can call 911.
"Agree, 5cm deep would completely transect the trachea and carotid arteries"
2 inches deep. That's a gusher for sure.
"https://worksafe.govt.nz/laws-and-regulations/enforceable-undertakings/accepted-enforceable-undertakings/st-kentigern-trust-board/

Here's the actual WorkSafe report."
"Site is reputable I can confirm that. Newshub is one of the two big TV news stations in NZ, along with TVNZ. They're actually one of the better online sources too; NZHerald online has gone to shit, Stuff.co.nz is the same."
"https://worksafe.govt.nz/laws-and-regulations/enforceable-undertakings/accepted-enforceable-undertakings/st-kentigern-trust-board/

Here's the actual WorkSafe report. It describes ""very serious lacerations"", from an actual razor.

The person saying fake news is faking for some reason, or possibly misinformed."
"That article is confusing. More than once in the article it says they were real razor blades covered in tape. Then later it says that they were prop blades.

  Either way, it sounds to me like the guy playing Sweeney Todd got overzealous during that scene."
"This article also says that the cuts were ""very serious""? It also says that they were absolutely real razors. Wrapped, but real."
Then let's make this a patriotic edition!

What he said.
Just looked up that scene. I think I‚Äôm watching hot fuzz now
This is my go-to movie to watch when I can't decide on anything else.  I've probably watched it 100 times and it still entertains me.  So good.
I never realized that...
"Yep. And I was wondering how it even happened to *two* kids. It must've been one immediately right after the other, without realizing it, because you'd think they would have stopped after the first kid's throat was cut."
it's called method acting sweaty
"For fucks sake an audience would never even be able to tell a blade wasn't loaded into any straight edge I've been shaved with, at a distance.

Like... So many bad decisions were made here.

ETA: FFS. I know there's a difference between straight edge razors and ones that take disposable blades. I think we can all pick up what I'm putting down without being pedantic assholes. Yeash."
We never ever use weapons that have previously held an edge in professional theatre in the U.S. It's an SAFD standard.

"True, my high school used confiscated fake guns when they were called for in the plays."
This was ~40 years ago. I'm sure she's retired by now.
They were quite illegal in the 1970s.
5cm turns you into a Pez dispenser
5cm deep throat slit? That's halfway decapitated.
"Well, not to be rude, but it kinda depends on the girth of the individual"
They did say the trachea was visible...
"As long as the major arteries and veins in your neck aren't severed, a punctured trachea would not kill you. 

A cut 5cm deep made with a straight razor would definitely do that, given how long the blade is, so it still doesn't make sense."
Daniel Day-Lewis would‚Äôve shed a tear.
"Humans can be shockingly hard to kill. Nothing like the movies. 

As long as you miss all the vitals and get immediate medical attention, survival rates are very high.

Even if you hit vitals, survival rates are way higher than you think. Around 12% of people stabbed in the heart survive. Gun shot wounds to the head have a 5% survival rate.

Then again, one bad piece of shrimp can make you poop yourself to death."
I mean he almost wasn't. Whoops.
In the video in the article it said that 'parts were 5cm deep' which seems more plausible than the entire cut
"You still missed it. The very last sentence on the page says:

>‚Äú...laceration to throat approx 5cm deep, ...‚Äù

The first part does mention the center 4.5cm of the 8cm long cut being the deepest portion, but a few sentences later it ALSO says the cut was is, in fact, 5cm *deep*

If it‚Äôs just a transcription of the emergency workers notes, however, they might not have copied over a comma which would have changed the meaning of the sentence entirely. For example they didn‚Äôt say ‚Äúlaceration to *the* throat,‚Äù just ‚Äúlaceration to throat.‚Äù It‚Äôs not much of a stretch to assume it could have been meant as ‚Äúlaceration to throat 5cm, *deep*, ...‚Äù but as it‚Äôs written it‚Äôs not actually misquoted to say it‚Äôs 5cm deep"

"I went to a college with a popular film school. A guy I knew rented a prop gun for a scene, and they showed him which ammo was live ammo and which were blanks. 

He flipped his shit and made them take all the ammo out of the case. The last thing he wanted was the liability of stupid college kids playing with live ammunition"

Barber shops often use these because it's a lot easier, and more hygienic since you can just use a new blade on every customer."
"I'm no expert on tape and razors, but yeah it's safe to say that tape wasn't the most protective choice."
"In the practices, a kid got a friction burn from the tape, *and then in a later practice* a kid got an actual small cut on the neck, from the ""tape wrapped razor""."

Depends on the school. My high school auditorium could seat 3k students. The stage was massive.
"Any time we use any sort of weapon in theater it‚Äôs almost always foam. Glue some gray foam to a stick and there you go. It doesn‚Äôt have to be detailed. No audience is close enough to really be able to tell. It‚Äôs different for full swords, but a small straight razor?"
"In the production that my high school put on, there's a pretty significant scene where Sweeny holds the razor up and the light glints off the metal edge. That probably isn't as significant with foam or painted wood.

I say ""significant"" because it was just kinda cool looking. It could have just as easily been removed. But my high school, with all of it's faults, didn't give the kid playing Sweeny a real straight-razor, so it ended up being pretty cool."
"Tru, but anything other than sharp is better"

"That‚Äôs actually the opposite of the Adler technique.  Stella Adler created her technique and founded the original Stella Adler school because she was horrified by the ‚Äúcruelty‚Äù of the techniques of Stanislavsky‚Äôs other disciples, particularly Strasberg‚Äôs Method.  The concept behind the Adler technique is to imagine extreme goals and situations that are not from the actors life, but which will create the right ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù of the characters emotional state to still create a realistic portrayal of the character and scene.  That‚Äôs obviously a simplified version and the full technique is way more complex, but that‚Äôs the gist.  A lot of hardcore Method actors look down on Adler because they feel it‚Äôs too ‚Äòartificial‚Äô and we‚Äôre supposed to suffer for our art, but it‚Äôs really cool how Adler was able to prioritize mental health and well-being while still being one of the greatest actors of her generation, and training several others, most famously Marlon Brando!

"Which is why fake alcohol always gets switched out for real alcohol on at least one night of all amateur productions.

Heck, even tea and coffee will be switched without the knowledge of the actor drinking on stage."
"Except when the prop is a deadly weapon.

When actors are using firearms on set the armorer must show the actors that the weapon is clear, then the actors must personally check that the weapon is clear.

A basic inspection of the blade would tell you that it isn't safe to run across someone's throat. If they were following proper procedure the prop master, the cutter, and the one who gets cut should all have inspected the prop to make sure it was safe.

That is your basic obligation when dealing with a deadly weapon.

You aren't absolved of responsibility because ""it's not my job."""
What an easily avoidable way to die. Hopefully his friends and family are able to recover as much as is possible.
"The accident happened because they broke multiple rules, and the firearms person on set was not doing their job correctly. It was an accident but it happened because they emptied the powder out of real rounds for one scene, rather than buying truly safe stage rounds. so the next seen the blank had a real round stuck in the barrel that it could fire out of the gun.

Edit: to be a little clearer, when they dumped the powder out of the normal casings/shells they put the unfired lead round back into the casings. These were to be used in a scene where the camera was facing down the length of the revolver, and in these scenes a blank round looks very different than a real one. Most studios will use fake rounds when this look is needed. When they dumped the powder out of the real rounds they failed to realize the primer remained in the shells, and this primer had enough power to propel one of the lead rounds into the barrel of the pistol, but not all the way out the end. Either no one noticed this had happened, or the person who accidentally fired the primer told no one. Thus when it came time for the scene where the blank was to be fired there was a round lodged in the barrel for the blank to propel out with deadly force. The firearms people on set, in addition to the carelessness of using real rounds at all, also failed to inspect the the pistol at multiple stages where these errors should have been discovered."
"Brandon Lee died because the production was too cheap to buy dummy cartridges, and the props people were incompetent about firearm safety.

The main antagonist had a revolver, which would allow the camera see blanks in close-up shots, so they needed dummy rounds for those shots. Rather than buy dummy ammo, they bought a box of live 44 magnum shells, pulled the bullets, emptied out the powder, then re-seated the bullets.

They did not consider the fact that each homemade ""dummy"" cartridge still had a live primer. They did their close-up shot, during which time the trigger was pulled by the actor. The primer was powerful enough to lodge the bullet in the barrel (called a squib).

The props people pulled their dummy cartridges from the revolver, not noticing that one of the bullets was now missing. Then they loaded the gun with blanks for the next shot.

During the next take, the actor pointed the gun directly at Brandon Lee's chest and pulled the trigger. The blank contained enough powder to launch the squib bullet with the force of an actual 44 magnum cartridge.

So, Lee was essentially shot in the heart at point blank range with a 44 magnum. He never had a chance."

"Sweeny Todd doesn't use a replaceable blade cartridge razor, it uses a straight razor. These look like folding knives with no point (which is what they are.) But you are right - the audience would not know that the blade had been rounded off and made so dull it cannot cut."
"To be honest, I don't think the audience would even care if the kids had nothing in their hands and simply pretended to use razors. Seriously would be better than the outcome at this school."
You don't 'load' real straight razors. They're basically long sharp knives.
"What you're referring to is a shavette. A true straight Blade has a single blade for the lifetime of the razor and has to be continually sharpened. Sweeney would have used a true straight Blade, but I totally agree that a shavette would have looked legit and wouldn't have to be loaded."

I've never met a drama student I'd have trusted with a sharp object. And sadly most of the teachers weren't that much more careful.
"That actor was Brandon Lee, son of the legendary Bruce Lee, who also died at a young age. Horrible tragedy."
"~~They were blanks, just the issue is a blank will still hurt or kill you if you aren't careful.~~
     
Edit: It was a total failure on the Prop team. They had lodged a bullet in the barrel and didn't clear it. At a later date they used a blank in the same gun which shot the lodged bullet out."
"Funnily enough, we built our own set in HS for me. Had a giant house prop (a kitchen, phone, and an upstairs with a bed) that we built from scratch. Was probably 6' deep, 20' long and 9 ft high. Thing weighed a ton, and one of the leads would be laying in the bed when we dragged it on stage. It was on caster wheels, and took a 4 man crew to get on/off stage. Had a cast iron stove from the 50s someone donated. All made by high schoolers with power tools. 

Idk where I'm going with this, but jesus Christ our supervisors were irresponsible. That thing was a massive liability in hindsight XD"

What is a drama teacher but an older theater kid?
"And he was the son of Lee Hoi-chuen, the celebrated actor and Opera star who lived to 64 and by all accounts had a splendid life."
"The problem with the prop people on The Crow was they cut corners and created an unsafe working environment.  For gun closeups, dummy rounds are used in the visible cylinders.  They look like real bullets but don't contain any gunpowder, just the bullet and the shell.  The prop people made these themselves by taking real bullets, removing the bullet from the shell, dumping out the powder, then replacing the bullet (cutting corners).  This meant their dummy bullets contained the bullet, the shell, AND the live primer.  During one take, they pulled the trigger on one of their unprofessionally made dummy bullets.  This ignited the primer, giving just enough force to push the bullet into the barrel where it remained for several days.  The gun with the lodged bullet was then loaded with blanks (which contains a primer and gunpowder, but no bullet).  When a blank was fired, the gunpowder propelled the bullet out of the chamber with nearly identical force to firing a live round.  Brandon Lee was on the receiving end of that bullet."
"> When a blank is fired, Mr. Rosen said, a piece of soft wadding normally comes out of the gun. But this time a metallic projectile came out, he said"
"No.  The misfired a real bullet, abd didn't get it out. Later, they fired a blank.  The blank firing propelled the misfired bullet, killing Brandon Lee."
"It's not that the blanks killed him, necessarily. 

What happened is that the prop crew improvised dummy cartridges, leaving primer charges still attached. This meant the 'inert' projectile still had a little bit of force propelling it, but not really enough to leave the barrel. The dummy cartridges were then used at some point during filming (resulting in a real bullet being lodged in the barrel), and then later swapped with the blanks. . .which *do* have the explosive force of a bullet, but no bullet or shot - just the empty cartridge. So, when the blank was fired, it combined the inert projectile stuck in the barrel with the explosive force from the blank, and essentially acted like a lethal round being fired off, with an extra cartridge from the blank along for the ride.

It was a tragic accident caused by a cost-cutting prop department, a lack of safety precautions when using a real firearm as a prop, and just plain bad luck that the bullet hit something vital resulting in a mortal wound."

It shouldn‚Äôt be any more pressure than tapping your hand on someone‚Äôs shoulder, or otherwise not touching them at all. 

You definitely do not have to gouge into someone‚Äôs neck to get the effect. Plenty enough people have managed to put on Sweeney Todd without doing so."
I've watched The Office and can confirm
This made be laugh.. but also valid point!
"But, I mean, potentially two less papers to have to grade."
You put the boom boom into my heart
"If a fire starts while you car is being fueled up (nozzle is still in the car) DO NOT REMOVE THE NOZZLE!!!!  It's just fumes that are burning at that moment, leave it the fuck alone and run for the emergency shut off button for the station.  Emergency stop buttons are well marked and obvious, and they shut off all pumping fuel.  Then call emergency services.  

Removing the nozzle will light the stream of gas on fire, obviously, and you will have a much much worse situation.  Plus your car will still have a gas fume fire which will eventually light the car on fire.  The fume fire can happily burn there for a while before the situation worsens (when the outside of the car or the nozzle finally starts to burn), but emergency services will have a much easier time dealing with one flaming car than an exploding gas station.

Just stuffing some wet towels around the opening of the gas tank (around the nozzle because you are not dumb enough to pull it out) or using an ABC (B specifically) fire extinguisher is enough to put out this kind of fire . . . assuming there is a reason to risk your life, like great-gma can't get out of the car or something.  Otherwise, let trained professionals deal with it and get away from the station.  These fires most often start because the person got back in their car while the pump was running, then didn't discharge the static before touching the liquid explosives dispenser they hooked their car up to."
"If I was holding a gas can and noticed the nozzle was on fire I would quickly set it down while being very careful to not let any gas flow towards the nozzle, and then find something to smother the nozzle with. I do not know if that is the correct procedure though. Ideally you would never bring it near a flame in the first place, but I'm sure you don't need to be told that."
"Seriously, it's a high-school play they aren't filming super closeups in 4k, you can get away with almost anything as a prop."
The kid got a cut 5 cm deep with visible cartilage. I'd risk jagged.
It is the music of a people who will not be slaves again!
SHUT IT
It disgusts me when I leave a Shakespeare production and I don't see a lengthy convoy of vans heading to the morgue.
"Agreed, I‚Äôm not having my kid on stage with a bunch of fucking amateurs"
"If that gun isn't loaded and cocked in a fight scene at my son's play, I'm moving school districts and leaving them a bad yelp review."
"Same. No one cares about authenticity anymore.

"I'm not your buddy, friend."

How big is average?  Asking for a friend.
A brick would probably suffice. No excuse for these people

"I know this is meant to be funny, but it‚Äôs a crappy way to make fun of someone‚Äôs job. Fine & performing arts teachers can be excellent artists/performers and excellent teachers at the same time. Or maybe they like teaching better than performing.

Edited to clarify: first older theater kid comment was funny to me... and true. Talent comment was not."
"It was a master level fuckup that should have been caught multiple times.

Around here our armor checks every weapon before and after it‚Äôs used for any reason.  It‚Äôs never handed off without a thorough inspection inside and out, and it is cleaned and ammunition is logged after it comes back.  Even our plugged-barrel blank firing weapons get checked in the same way.  (This is for live theatre.)"
"Well, it did. 

It just did it by further propelling a bullet."
"I've considered writing a book titled Suicide, Getting it Right the First Time."
"The result I want is an erection and side to side does that just fine, so don't kinkshame me."
Any vaguely stick shaped object would've done the trick.
"I assume they used a real straight razor and not a shavette with is what that is but yeah, you could just remove the disposable razor in one of those and it would look like a straight razor from the audience."
ü§¢
That's what I've been thinking the whole time. Why the fuck was the actor plunging what he knew was a real razor so deep into their necks in the first place?
4 if you count the two doing the murder.
"I dunno, I think that everyone has a plan until their gas can nozzle is on fire."

YARP.
If you're not willing to die for the production then why tf did you sign up for *Death of a Salesman*?
This has to be a r/BrandNewSentence
If you're not willing to bleed for your art then you're a fucking poser.
They took these kids to the hospital?! Did they at least wait until intermission so it didn't hurt the flow?
"He's not your friend, guy."
Which makes more sense. Why the hell would the smartest student of their year need the concept of being nearly headless explained to her? I often forget how hard and fast Hermione fell victim to the Legolas effect at the hands of Steve Kloves
If it fits into your mom nice and snug then it's definitely much larger than average.
Yea you don't need specialty equipment to dull a blade . Using tape is just plain negligent and should be criminal imo .
"Exactly this. Any faculty member could dull the blades themselves with something as simple as a brick, sandpaper, or their own front porch."

"I always promised myself that if I ever decide to off myself that I'm going to go up onto the roof of a really tall building with a bunch of dynamite strapped to my chest, then jump off and detonate it on the way down."
I would imagine there would it be a lot of reread-ability in that book.
There's one but it's ban pretty much everywhere.
"Suicide, Getting it Right the First Time. A first hand account of a survivor."
"1. Drop

2. Run

3. Scream like a little girl

Doesn't even have to be a gas can, if I pick up a newspaper with a spider on it I'm gone."
"I had a fire climb back and get into the nozzle.  Just put it down, dragged it away and then scurried away for a bit.  


Up there with my torch starting to burn down and dunking it in tiki torch fluid to put it out.


This is after several burns and singed eyebrows"

Narp.
A high school play without at least 3 actual student deaths is considered a dull affair.
"I‚Äôm not your guy, pal!"
"Instructions unclear, am now a FatherBrother"
"I forget the guys name but there was an incident where this guy tried to commit suicide by hanging himself off a bridge after drinking poison and lighting himself on fire.

The fire burned through the rope, dropping him in the river. The water put out the fire and the cold caused him to vomit up the poison. Despite this miraculous survival, he died several days later of hypothermia"
1 stick would suffice. Too much and you increase potential innocent injuries/death and then you're just a shitty person.

"No no, you get a nice thin steel cable, a bungee jumping cord, and a big container of super glue.

Tie off the steel cable to the roof, then measure out a quarter of the building height, trim, and tie the other end around your neck.  Secure the bungee jumping cord to the building at one end and your legs at the other - make sure it‚Äôs the right length to stop your fall so you don‚Äôt hit the ground.

As a last step before taking the plunge, take the superglue and apply it liberally to your hands, then reach up over the steel noose and grab each side of your head.

The poor bastard that gets a warm blood shower from a bungee jumping, blood-spurting corpse with its head held in its hands?  Yep, that‚Äôs the money shot."
"Slit wrists at the top of a tall building, take a huge excess of some kind of speedball, jump down the elevator shaft.

If you time it right, it should be impossible to tell whether you died of the blood loss, the OD, or the sudden stop."
Points for style I guess.
